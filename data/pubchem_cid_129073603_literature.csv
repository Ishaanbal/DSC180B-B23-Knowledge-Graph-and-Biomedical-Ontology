Serial analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has proven effective in monitoring disease control/progression and therapeutic response in NSCLC. In this prospective study, we analyzed longitudinal ctDNA profiles (at baseline, week 8, and at progression) in Chinese patients with advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC treated with pralsetinib (NCT03037385), utilizing allele frequency-based, cfDNA quantity-normalized, and methylation-based metrics. Associations between ctDNA dynamics, tumor response, and genomic alterations were assessed. A total of 21 patients were enrolled. Baseline PIK3CA co-mutations were associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS; 3.0 vs. 12.4 months, P < 0.001). Superior PFS was observed in patients with lower baseline ctDNA levels across all metrics: allele frequency-based (HR = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07–0.80; P = 0.012), cfDNA quantity-normalized (HR = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.05–0.71; P = 0.006), and methylation-based (HR = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01–0.85; P = 0.010). Early ctDNA clearance at the first radiographic assessment was also associated with prolonged PFS (median PFS not reached vs. 4.8 months; P = 0.002) and enhanced disease control (71.4% vs. 0%). Moreover, three distinct ctDNA dynamic profiles—clearance-rebound, reduction-rebound, and sustained clearance—were associated with different progression patterns (systemic progression, new extrathoracic lesions, new intracranial/intrathoracic lesions). No evidence of histologic transformation was identified at the time of progression. KRAS G12R and other non-canonical alterations emerged in ctDNA-rebound samples. Molecular progression preceded radiographic progression by a mean interval of 2.2 months. These findings suggest that ctDNA-based surveillance using multiple metrics, enables early forecasting of tumor response and progression in RET fusion-positive NSCLC. Early ctDNA clearance and dynamic profiles provide non-invasive biomarkers for early intervention, warranting further validation with ctDNA-guided strategies.",Biomarker Research,"Chang Lu, Chong-Rui Xu, Yi-Chen Zhang, E-E Ke, Yue-Li Sun, Xiao-Yan Bai, Zhi-Hong Chen, Jian Su, Yu Deng, Ting Hou, Fei Zhao, Min Li, Bin-Chao Wang, Hai-Yan Tu, Zhen Wang, Xu-Chao Zhang, Hua-Jun Chen, Jin-Ji Yang, Wen-Zhao Zhong, Qing Zhou, Yi-Long Wu",,English,Biomedical and Life Sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12288196,,"Circulating tumor DNA, Non-small-cell lung cancer, Pralsetinib, RET, Tyrosine kinase inhibitor","Lu C, Xu CR, Zhang YC, Ke EE, Sun YL, Bai XY, Chen ZH, Su J, Deng Y, Hou T, Zhao F, Li M, Wang BC, Tu HY, Wang Z, Zhang XC, Chen HJ, Yang JJ, Zhong WZ, Zhou Q, Wu YL.

One contributing factor is the identification of actionable biomarkers through routine molecular profiling and immunohistochemistry, which has been linked to improvements in both overall survival and disease-free survival. Major guidelines recommend the use of comprehensive molecular panels that include genes such as EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, MET (exon 14 skipping and amplification), ALK, ROS1, RET, and NTRK1/2/3 fusions, along with PD-L1 immunoexpression, in tissue specimens or liquid biopsy for patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

In the present review, we have focused on the structural diversity of pyrazole in drug discovery and the critical analysis of approved drugs bearing this versatile pharmacophore in the past decade (2014-2023). The investigation of the USFDA-approved drug-bearing pyrazole scaffold revealed that a total of 20 drugs were approved during the period of analysis. The bifurcation of approved drugs led us to conclude that nine drugs (45%) were to treat cancer, followed by four drugs for rare genetic diseases, three for treating infection, two for neurological conditions, and one for rheumatoid arthritis and glaucoma, respectively. The investigation also revealed that the majority of drugs (65%) were indicated to be used in rare forms of cancer and diseases. Besides this, the review also highlighted that 53% of approved drugs were launched in tablet form, and 80% of these drugs were intended to be given by oral route. The drug metabolism analysis revealed that 25% of approved drugs undergo Phase 1 metabolism via CYP3A4, followed by the combined involvement of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 for 10% of approved drugs. The drugs are chiefly excreted via the fecal route (12) and the urine (7). The structural diversity revealed that the majority of pyrazole drugs comprised a pyridine ring (7) in conjugation. At the same time, fluorine was the key halogen substituent, and amine was the major non-halogenated substituent in the approved drugs. The review is, therefore, a congregated effort to not only compile and update the USFDA-approved drugs containing pyrazole but also explore their in-depth medicinal chemistry-based analysis to enrich the medicinal chemist and allied sciences researchers for their comprehensive read.",Molecular Diversity,"Nisha Bansal, Elagandhula Sathish, M.

We aimed to investigate the reporting quality in the published articles of DECs. METHODS: We retrospectively identified the published articles of DEC pivotal trials of the FDA-approved targeted anticancer drugs between Jan 1st, 2012 and March 31st, 2023. All published articles were evaluated by using the CONSORT Dose-finding Extension (CONSORT-DEFINE) guidance. RESULTS: Forty-one articles on DEC trials were identified, of which 32 (78.0%) were published in journals with a high impact factor (≥ 50). The median proportion of adequately reported items in the evaluated 41 articles was 83.7% (with an interquartile range of 79.1% to 88.4%). Inadequacies were observed in several areas of DEC trial reporting. Specifically, planned cohort size (item 3a8), dose modification and discontinuation (item 5b), sample size calculation (item 7a), interim analysis (item 7b), adjusted analyses (item 12b) for efficacy endpoints, data monitoring (item 26), safety review committee (item 26a), and the role of funders (item 25) were mentioned in only 4 (9.8%), 17 (41.5%), 30 (73.2%), 14 (34.1%), 30 (73.2%), 6 (14.6%), 4 (9.8%), and 12 (29.3%) articles, respectively. Additionally, inconsistencies were noted in the definition of DEC across different articles, revealing irregular naming methods being used.

RET inhibitors (RETi) have revolutionized treatment for these patients, but resistance remains an important clinical challenge limiting therapy effectiveness. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying resistance to RETi. Methods: NSCLC cells were exposed to increasing doses of RETi (pralsetinib/BLU-667 and selpercatinib/LOXO-292) to generate resistant cells. RNA-Sequencing analysis identified differentially expressed genes in resistant versus sensitive cells, followed by in vitro and in vivo functional assays to explore novel therapeutic strategies. Additionally, tumor biopsies from RET-rearranged NSCLC patients who exhibited cancer progression on RET inhibitor therapy were analyzed. Results: RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the upregulation of the EGFR signaling pathway and hyperactivation of AP1 complex members in resistant cells compared to sensitive cells. Silencing of EGFR and AP1 complex members significantly reversed drug resistance, whereas EGFR overexpression reduced the sensitivity of parental Lc2/AD cells to RET inhibitors. Furthermore, the combination of RET and EGFR inhibitors showed synergistic antitumor activity in vitro and hindered tumor growth in mouse models with resistant cell xenografts. Notably, we observed a significant increase in EGFR expression in tumor biopsies from NSCLC patients treated with RET inhibitors who experienced disease progression, further validating the clinical relevance of our findings. Conclusions: This study elucidates EGFR's role in mediating resistance to RET inhibitors in NSCLC patients.

The occurrence of thyroid carcinoma metastasizing to the breast is infrequent, with the mechanism of dissemination remaining unclear. A 63-year-old female presented with a painful, progressive mass on the right breast upper outer quadrant for 3 months with bloody discharge from the nipple and cervical lymphadenopathy level 2-5 by axillary lymphadenopathy and shortness of breath. On examination, 8 cm ×6 cm, a well-defined lump was palpable on the right breast, with soft to firm consistency. The swelling was fixed to the underlying tissues. The patient had undergone a total thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma 10 years back and another surgery for pre-sternal thyroid swelling 3 years back which was also papillary carcinoma. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was inconclusive and a core cut biopsy from the breast was taken which was suggestive of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Henceforth a Positron emission tomography (PET) scan was done that showed increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake by the lesion, cervical and axillary lymph nodes. The patient was advised for radioactive iodine ablation and palliation. DISCUSSION: Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common thyroid malignancy, often spreading via lymphatics. Regional metastasis to the neck is frequent, though metastasis outside the deep cervical chain is rare. Distant metastases occur in 1% of PTC patients mainly in the lungs and bones. The precise mechanisms enabling the spread of thyroid carcinoma to the breast remain insufficiently understood. A small subset of medullary thyroid carcinomas has been observed to display metastasis to the breast, which majorly disseminates by hematogenous route. Ours is a rare case of PTC showcasing metastasis to the breast. Proposed mechanisms encompass dissemination via intraoperative seeding and lymphatic routes. CONCLUSION: Metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma to the breast is very rare in the current body of literature; however, a small number of cases of medullary thyroid carcinomas in the breast have been identified, predominantly disseminated via the hematogenous route. Therefore, the identification of a mass in the breast may warrant consideration as a metastatic lesion in the setting of pre-existing thyroid carcinoma. Radioactive iodine ablation (RAI) and radiotherapy might be recommended for palliation.",World Journal of Surgical Oncology,"Lovenish Bains, Uday Kumar Katuri, Chaitanya Polisetty, Pawan Lal, Meeta Singh",,English,"Middle Aged; Carcinoma, Papillary*/secondary/surgery; Lymphatic Metastasis; Humans; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Breast Neoplasms*/secondary/diagnostic imaging; Thyroidectomy; Prognosis; Positron-Emission Tomography; Thyroid Cancer, Papillary; Thyroid Neoplasms*/pathology/surgery; Medicine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12067752,,"Breast metastasis, Lymph nodes, Metastasis, Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)","Bains L, Katuri UK, Polisetty C, Lal P, Singh M.

Selpercatinib and pralsetinib, both specific RET-kinase inhibitors, are the only FDA-approved drugs for treating RET-altered thyroid cancer. We wanted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of selpercatinib and pralsetinib in RET-altered thyroid cancers. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases for randomized controlled trials and observational studies published up to March 30, 2024, and included those that reported any of the desired endpoints. The primary endpoints were 1-year progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR). Quantitative analyses were performed using the R programming language. We included four studies with 560 patients, 510 with RET-mutant and 50 with RET-fusion thyroid cancer. The 1-year PFS was 84% (95% CI, 79–88, I 2 = 43%), ORR was 69% (95% CI, 65–73, I 2 = 0) and DCR was 93% (95% CI, 89–96, I 2 = 44%). Some important grade ≥3 adverse events were hypertension (16%; 95% CI, 11–22; I 2 = 43%), diarrhea (3%; 95% CI, 2–5; I 2 = 0), increased ALT (11%; 95% CI, 8–14; I 2 = 0) and increased AST (6%; 95% CI, 4–10; I 2 = 0).

AIM: This study aimed to analyze pralsetinib-related adverse events (AEs) reported in the Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database to identify potential safety signals. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective pharmacovigilance analysis using FAERS database from Q3 2020 to Q2 2024. After deduplication, disproportionality analysis was performed using four algorithms: reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio, Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and empirical Bayes geometric mean. RESULTS: A total of 1064 pralsetinib-related reports were identified, encompassing 3608 AEs. The most common AEs were hypertension (n = 80), asthenia (n = 79), anemia (n = 65), white blood cell count decreased (n = 63), and constipation (n = 58).

However, for unresectable BTCs, systemic therapy has been uniformly applied. Gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) therapy and GC-based therapies were established as the first-line standard BTC treatment. However, no highly effective second-line therapy has been established, and the prognosis remains poor, highlighting the need for further therapeutic advancements. Meanwhile, the era of precision medicine has expanded the use of genetic testing, leading to the identification of actionable molecular targets in BTC. Several targeted therapies, including FGFR inhibitors and IDH1 inhibitors, have been developed, offering new second-line treatment options and the potential for first-line use in appropriate cases. Notably, the frequency of these genetic alterations varies depending on the tumor location, demonstrating the molecular heterogeneity of BTC. Therefore, it has been recognized that a tailored treatment approach for each BTC patient may be more effective than uniform systemic therapy. Consequently, although routine genetic testing before initiating systemic treatment is currently limited by the medical environment (e.g., cost, accessibility, regional differences), it is recommended in ESMO guideline and might be increasingly advocated. However, BTC harbors a wide range of genetic alterations, and numerous targeted therapies are being developed accordingly.

Cancers driven by gene fusion products tend to respond well to targeted therapies, where available; thus, detection of potentially targetable oncogenic fusions is necessary to select optimal treatment. Detection methods include non-sequencing methods, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, and sequencing methods, such as DNA- and RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS). While NGS is an efficient way to analyze multiple genes of interest at once, economic and technical factors may preclude its use in routine care globally, despite several guideline recommendations. The aim of this review is to present a summary of oncogenic gene fusions, with a focus on fusions that affect tyrosine kinase signaling, and to highlight the importance of testing for oncogenic fusions. We present an overview of the identification of oncogenic gene fusions and therapies approved for the treatment of cancers harboring gene fusions, and summarize data regarding treating fusion-positive cancers with no current targeted therapies and clinical studies of fusion-positive cancers.

Since 2024, the non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) landscape has undergone a transformative shift, driven by 11 FDA approvals. Recent advances in molecular profiling, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies have revolutionized NSCLC management, ushering in an era of personalized treatment with improved patient outcomes. The increased adoption of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for screening has enhanced early detection, enabling intervention at more curable stages. Molecular diagnostics now play a pivotal role in guiding treatment strategies, with actionable genomic alterations (AGAs) informing the use of EGFR, ALK, ROS1, KRAS, NRG1, and other targeted inhibitors in both early and advanced settings. For instance, targeted therapies are increasingly being integrated into early-stage management, with adjuvant osimertinib for EGFR -mutated NSCLC and alectinib for ALK -positive NSCLC demonstrating substantial survival benefits. Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, has become a cornerstone of treatment for AGA-negative NSCLC, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, and is increasingly being utilized in the perioperative setting. Furthermore, emerging therapies such as bispecific antibodies, antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs), and novel immunotherapeutic agents show promise in addressing resistance mechanisms and improving outcomes in advanced-stage disease. Although new challenges arise, the evolving NSCLC treatment paradigm continues to prioritize precision medicine, offering hope for prolonged survival and enhanced quality of life for patients.",Lung,"Hyein Jeon, Shuai Wang, Junmin Song, Harjot Gill, Haiying Cheng",,English,"Humans; Lung Neoplasms*/therapy/genetics/diagnosis/pathology; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/therapy/genetics/diagnosis/pathology; Immunotherapy/methods; Medicine; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/therapeutic use",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11937135,,"Actionable Genomic Alterations, Immunotherapy, Lung Cancer Management, NSCLC, Targeted Therapy","Jeon H, Wang S, Song J, Gill H, Cheng H.

Since the publication of first China consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of RAIR-DTC in 2019, significant and rapid advances have occurred in the field both in China and internationally. This guideline aims to inform Chinese clinicians, researchers, patients, and health policy makers on the latest evidence and recommendations, to further standardize the clinical diagnosis and treatment of RAIR-DTC. METHODS: The structured clinical questions addressed in this guideline were derived from clinical diagnostic and treatment processes, with references to study, prior guidelines, expert consensus, and systematic reviews, etc. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the evidence. The editorial process was completely independent of the guideline development group. RESULTS: The guideline addressed 26 clinical questions and formed 35 recommendations. In this guideline, the definition criteria for RAIR-DTC was optimized, prediction and identification was based on evidence including molecular testing, dynamic biochemical changes, and multimodal imaging. Comprehensive pre-treatment clinical evaluation was emphasized and tailored for individualized decision-making. The combination of systematic therapy and surgery, and the redifferentiation followed by RAI therapy were also reviewed and updated. Molecular imaging plays a unique role in the pre-assessing and therapeutic response evaluation for RAIR-DTC. CONCLUSIONS: We have updated and developed evidence-based recommendations with the aim of providing scientific, rigorous, and comprehensive guidance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of RAIR-DTC patients in China.

Initial attempts to target RET fusion–positive NSCLC with poorly selective multikinase RET inhibitors were associated with significant toxicities and limited efficacy. Two highly potent and selective RET small‐molecule inhibitors, selpercatinib and pralsetinib, were granted accelerated approval for advanced RET fusion–positive NSCLC by the US Food and Drug Administration, and have been shown to be highly effective both in treatment‐naive and previously treated patients with NSCLC. Selpercatinib has shown superiority over chemotherapy in a phase 3 study (LIBRETTO‐431) in previously untreated patients with RET fusion–positive NSCLC, which established its place as the standard of care in this patient population.

This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of liquid biopsy in detecting genetic mutations in NSCLC, focusing on its sensitivity, specificity, clinical utility, and potential to guide personalized treatment strategies. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to identify relevant studies published between 1990 and September 2024. Eligible studies included comparative analyses of liquid biopsy techniques for NSCLC diagnosis, prognosis, progression, or treatment response. This review adheres to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and assesses study quality using the QUADAS framework. RESULTS: A total of 30 studies were included. Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) demonstrated the highest sensitivity, detecting low-frequency mutations such as EGFR T790M at levels as low as 0.01%. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provided comprehensive mutational profiling, revealing tumor heterogeneity and co-existing mutations but required high-quality plasma samples. The cobas EGFR Mutation Test, while less sensitive than ddPCR, remains widely used due to its clinical accessibility. Emerging methods, including extracellular vesicle analysis, show promise but require further validation. Additionally, liquid biopsy effectively identified non-EGFR mutations, such as KRAS, ALK, and MET amplifications, expanding its clinical applicability. CONCLUSION: Liquid biopsy is a transformative tool in NSCLC management, offering a minimally invasive approach for mutation detection, disease monitoring, and treatment guidance.

In the past two decades, multiple kinase inhibitors have been developed, including those that are clinically effective regardless of tumour location, provided that the tumour harbours the aberrantly activated kinase. Consequently, a biomarker-based therapy model, untethered from tumour histology and organ of origin, has been established, which has led to transformative regulatory approvals of tumour-agnostic kinase inhibitors such as larotrectinib, selpercatinib, dabrafenib-trametinib and pemigatinib. However, almost all such approvals are partial in nature, as they do not include both solid and haematological cancers, even if the kinase inhibitor has shown activity in both. Moreover, clinical trials to assess these compounds are challenging because genomic sequencing of hundreds or thousands of tumours may be required to find eligible patients whose malignancy bears the targeted genetic alterations. In this Review, we describe the precision medicine paradigm that has successfully launched tumour-agnostic drug development, concentrating on small-molecule inhibitors that target kinase pathway aberrations, and we discuss the challenges in developing tumour-agnostic agents.",Nature reviews.

However, the efficacy in patients with acquired RET fusion after resistance to EGFR/ALK-TKIs has only been reported on a case-by-case basis, and the strategy for overcoming the acquired RET fusion has not been fully investigated. This multicenter, real-world analysis enrolled 32 patients with unresectable NSCLC harbored acquired RET fusion after resistance to EGFR/ALK-TKIs in 23 centers across China from July 1st, 2018 to Nov 23rd, 2022. Epidemiological, clinical, genetic, and treatment data were collected. The primary outcome was time to treatment failure (TTF). Secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and toxicity. In real-world context, patients underwent pralsetinib-based treatment had a higher proportion of central nervous system metastasis. EGFR 19del was the predominant mutation type (62.5 %) prior to acquired RET fusion. CCDC6 was the commonest RET fusion partner (40.6 %). 'Clonal RET fusion' (c-RET) and 'subclonal RET fusion' (s-RET) were defined according to the RET fusion allele frequency. Patients with c-RET had higher proportions of undetected EGFR mutation and KIF5B-RET fusion. First-line pralsetinib-based therapy had notably superior median TTF when compared to their counterparts (8.03 versus 4.30 months, P = 0.016). Notably, patients with c-RET had a better prognosis than those with s-RET (median TTF: NR versus 5.67 months, P = 0.037, median OS: NR versus 9.83 months, P = 0.047).

The safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of HA121-28 were assessed in advanced solid tumors (phase 1, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03994484) and advanced RET fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (RET-TKI naive NSCLC, phase 2, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05117658). HA121-28 was administered orally in doses range from 25 to 800 mg under the 21-day on/7-day off scheme for a 28-day cycle in phase 1 trial. The recommended dose identified in phase 1 (450 mg) was administered for patients during phase 2. The primary endpoints were the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in phase 1 and the objective response rate (ORR) in phase 2. 162 patients were enrolled in phase 1 and 48 in phase 2. A total of 600 mg once daily was set as MTD. Across 100–800 mg, the exposure of HA121-28 increased in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent between both trials, diarrhea, rash, and prolonged QTc interval, were the most reported treatment-emergent adverse events. 40.0% (phase 1) and 62.5% (phase 2) patients experienced grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events, respectively. The overall ORR was 26.8% and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.5 months among 97 NSCLC patients with advanced RET fusion receiving a dose at ≥450 mg once daily. HA121-28 showed encouraging efficacy in advanced RET fusion NSCLC and its toxicity was tolerable in most patients.

There are few studies concerning the genetic background of PPTC in Asian countries. In this study, we reviewed 124 cases of PPTC from a single medical center in China. DNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to identify genetic alterations, with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) fusions further validated by RNA-based NGS. DICER1 mutations and TERT promoter mutations were detected by Sanger sequencing. We also explored the relationship between these genetic alterations and the clinicopathologic features, as well as the prognostic factors. Three recombinant plasmids expressing V5/HIS-tagged RTK fusion proteins (BEND7::ALK, DLG5::RET, CCDC30::ROS1) were constructed to investigate the in vitro effects. We found that the two most common subtypes were the classic subtype (77.4%) and the diffuse sclerosing subtype (17.7%). Hashimoto's thyroiditis was observed in 42.3% of cases, and regional lymph node metastasis was present in 82.9% of patients. The most frequent genetic alteration was the BRAF c.1799 T > A (p.V600E) mutation (63 patients, 50.8%), followed by RTK fusions (31 patients, 25.0%). A DICER1 mutation was detected in two cases, and TERT promoter mutations were not observed in any of the patients. RTK fusions were associated with the diffuse sclerosing subtype, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and extrathyroidal extension. Adverse prognostic factors identified included RTK fusion, age under 14 years, and tumor size over 2 cm. Additionally, a significant proportion of these patients had actionable molecular alterations. Three rare kinase fusions, BEND7::ALK, DLG5::RET, and CCDC30::ROS1, were shown to induce phosphorylation of the MAPK pathway and promote cell proliferation in vitro. The specific RTK inhibitors could counteract the fusion-induced cell proliferation. Our data highlights the genetic landscape of Chinese PPTC patients, with RTK fusions being associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features.

Anti-cancer treatments are often unsuccessful, and single-cell technologies to rein drug resistance mechanisms are still fruitless. The National Cancer Institute defines aggressive cancers at the tissue level, describing them as those that spread rapidly, despite severe treatment. At the molecular, foundational level, the quantitative biophysics discipline defines aggressive cancers as harboring a large number of (overexpressed, or mutated) crucial signaling proteins in major proliferation pathways populating their active conformations, primed for their signal transduction roles. This comprehensive review explores highly aggressive cancers on the foundational and cell signaling levels, focusing on the differences between highly aggressive cancers and the more treatable ones. It showcases aggressive tumors as harboring massive, cancer-promoting, catalysis-primed oncogenic proteins, especially through certain overexpression scenarios, as predisposed aggressive tumor candidates. Our examples narrate strong activation of ERK1/2, and other oncogenic proteins, through malfunctioning chromatin and crosslinked signaling, and how they activate multiple proliferation pathways. They show the increased cancer heterogeneity, plasticity, and drug resistance. Our review formulates the principles underlying cancer aggressiveness on the molecular level, discusses scenarios, and describes drug regimen (single drugs and drug combinations) for PDAC, NSCLC, CRC, HCC, breast and prostate cancers, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and leukemia as examples. All show overexpression scenarios of master transcription factors, transcription factors with gene fusions, copy number alterations, dysregulation of the epigenetic codes and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions in aggressive tumors, as well as high mutation loads of vital upstream signaling regulators, such as EGFR, c-MET, and K-Ras, befitting these principles.",Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy,"Ruth Nussinov, Bengi Ruken Yavuz, Hyunbum Jang",,English,"Drug Resistance, Neoplasm*/genetics; Neoplasms*/genetics/pathology/metabolism/drug therapy; Cell Proliferation/genetics; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics; Signal Transduction/genetics; Medicine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11830828,,,"Nussinov R, Yavuz BR, Jang H.

Enhanced mitochondrial function can promote NSCLC progression by enabling metabolic reprogramming, resistance to apoptosis, and increased cell proliferation. Mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2), located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, is pivotal in regulating mitochondrial activities. This study examines MTCH2 expression and its functional role in NSCLC. Bioinformatic analysis showed that MTCH2 is overexpressed in NSCLC tissues, correlating with poor prognosis and other key clinical parameters of the patients. In addition, single-cell sequencing data revealed higher MTCH2 expression levels in cancer cells of NSCLC tumor mass. Moreover, MTCH2 is also upregulated in locally-treated NSCLC tissues and multiple primary/established human NSCLC cells. In various NSCLC cells, silencing MTCH2 via targeted shRNA or knockout (KO) using the CRISPR/Cas9 method significantly hindered cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while inducing apoptosis. MTCH2 knockdown or KO robustly impaired mitochondrial function, as indicated by reduced mitochondrial respiration, decreased complex I activity, lower ATP levels, lower mitochondrial membrane potential (mitochondrial depolarization), and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of MTCH2 in primary NSCLC cells enhanced mitochondrial complex I activity and ATP production, promoting cell proliferation and migration. In vivo, the intratumoral injection of MTCH2 shRNA adeno-associated virus (aav) impeded the growth of subcutaneous xenografts of primary NSCLC cells in nude mice. In MTCH2 shRNA aav-injected NSCLC xenograft tissues, there was decreases in MTCH2 expression, mitochondrial complex I activity, ATP content, and the glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio, but increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBAR) activity. Additionally, MTCH2 silencing led to reduced Ki-67 staining but increased apoptosis in NSCLC xenografts.

Cases of NSCLC transforming into SCLC have been discovered. However, we lack concentrated data on the characteristics of this population and the transformed SCLC to aid our insight of the biology and clinical value of NSCLC transforming with positive. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the published literatures and summarized the pathological and clinical characteristics, and the prognosis, of published cases. RESULTS: 140 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) were included in this study, with a median age of 56.8 years. The median time from the first diagnosis of LUAD transforming to SCLC (ttSCLC) was 20.0 months. The median overall survival (mOS) after the diagnosis of SCLC was 11.0 months (95% CI, 7.41 to 14.59 months). In the univariate analysis, ever smoking (either former or current) was a promising predictor of a shorter ttSCLC (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.62; P = 0.010). TKIs therapy administered as a second line and beyond treatment was related to a significant delay in SCLC onset compared to first-line therapy (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.96; P = 0.031). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) on first-line platinum plus etoposide after the conversion to SCLC was 3.0 months.

Its clinical presentation is often atypical, and standardized treatment guidelines are currently unavailable. While genetic alterations in adult PACC have been studied to some extent, knowledge of genetic abnormalities in pediatric cases remains limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of pediatric PACC in a 7-year-old male presenting with a large, non-tender abdominal mass (11 cm x 11 cm) on the right side. Pathological and imaging evidence confirmed the diagnosis of PACC, with no lymph node infiltration or distant metastasis. Comprehensive genomic profiling by next-generation sequencing identified a non-canonical BRAF fusion with KMT2C at the DNA level and a classic SND1-BRAF fusion at the RNA level. The patient underwent surgical resection through a Whipple operation followed by six cycles of mFOLIRINOX chemotherapy and radiation therapy, achieving a favorable outcome up to now. CONCLUSIONS: Next-generation sequencing has demonstrated significant value in identifying genetic fusions in pediatric PACC. In our case report, we identified both the classical SND1-BRAF fusion, commonly associated with PACC, and a previously unreported nonclassical BRAF-KMT2C fusion. These findings underscore the critical role of BRAF alterations as key drivers of oncogenesis in PACC.

There is an increasing number of clinical studies related to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), yet the efficacy and safety of different drugs vary. In this single-arm meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy and safety of TKIs for chordoma treatment, 12 studies involving 365 patients were analyzed. The findings suggest that TKIs can improve outcomes, with an objective response rate of 1.7% and 29% based on RECIST and Choi criteria, a median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 8.41 months and a median overall survival (mOS) of 36.6 months. Imatinib, in particular, showed a longer mOS of 39.3 months compared to 25.0 months for other TKIs. However, high toxicity was noted, with a 95% overall incidence of adverse events (AEs), including hypertension, nausea and vomiting, and edema. Serious AEs occurred at a rate of 55%. In subgroup analysis, Imatinib showed a lower incidence of AEs compared to other TKIs. Combination therapy reduced the risk of severe adverse events compared to monotherapy. The study underscores the potential of TKIs to extend survival in chordoma patients but also highlights the need for careful management of treatment-related toxicity. Combining TKIs, especially imatinib, with other treatments may avoid serious adverse events.

Recent advances in targeted therapies have opened new avenues for intervention in PDAC, focusing on key genetic and molecular pathways that drive tumor progression. METHODS: In this review, we provide an overview on advances in novel targeted therapies in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Here, we explore the latest development in targeting the KRAS pathway, a historically 'undruggable' target crucial to PDAC pathogenesis. Strategies to inhibit KRAS include direct KRAS-targeted therapies, modulation of upstream and downstream signaling, KRAS-specific siRNA, and novel combination therapies integrating KRAS inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade, PARP inhibitors, chemotherapy, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and autophagy modulators. Beyond KRAS, emerging targets such as NRG1 fusions, NTRK/ROS1 fusions, RET alterations, and the PRMT5/CDKN2A/MAT2A axis, along with EGFR and Claudin18.2 inhibitors, are also discussed as promising therapeutic strategies. Additionally, the review highlights novel approaches for microsatellite instability-high (MSIH) PDAC and emerging therapies, including adoptive cell therapies (CAR-T, TCR, TIL), cancer vaccines, and strategies to modify the tumor microenvironment.

We reviewed our single-center experience using a RETi to treat advanced hMTC. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with hMTC treated with a selective RETi at a tertiary cancer center. The primary outcome was overall response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), biochemical response rate, and safety. Results: We identified 23 evaluable patients as follows: 15 (65%) multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)2A and 8 (35%) MEN2B. Median age at start of RETi was 51 years (range, 15-79). All patients had distant metastases, and 52% (12/23) had received prior systemic therapy (median = 1, range, 0-3). Patients were treated with selpercatinib (n = 13) or pralsetinib (n = 10), 57% (13/23) within a clinical trial. Median duration of RETi was 25 months (range, 3-72) with 11/23 (48%) patients remaining on drug at data cutoff due to an ongoing response. Median duration of follow-up was 49 months (range, 9-72). Best radiographical response was partial response in 18 (78%) and stable disease in 5 (22%) patients. Median OS was 51 months (confidence interval, 40.5-61.3); median PFS was not reached. Most common adverse events (AEs) were increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (48%) and aspartate aminotransferase (26%), dry mouth (39%), QT interval prolongation (39%), fatigue (35%), and hypertension (26%). AEs led to dose reductions in eight (35%) patients. No grade 5 treatment-related AEs occurred. While the germline nature of the RET pathogenic variant in hMTC could hypothetically result in increased drug-related toxicity, the incidence of most AEs, other than grade 1-2 ALT elevation and QT interval prolongation, was comparable to published clinical trials. Conclusions: In patients with advanced hMTC, selective RETis appear safe and effective with outcomes similar to clinical trial cohorts, which mostly comprised patients with sMTC. Duration of response and AE profile was similar to sMTC, although longer follow-up and larger patient numbers are needed to confirm this.",Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,"Sarah Hamidi, Sireesha Yedururi, Mimi I.

In a subset of patients, the cancer is more aggressive with symptomatic or progressive disease metastasizing to cervical neck structures, lungs, liver, and/or bones. Definitive cure for metastatic MTC remains elusive. Understanding oncogenic pathways and molecular drivers of disease have led to development and approval of multikinase and highly-specific RET inhibitors for the management of progressive MTC. RET mutations are the most common drivers in MTC, followed by mutually exclusive RAS mutations. Cabozantinib and vandetanib, multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) that exert their therapeutic effect mainly through antiangiogenesis by targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, have mild anti-RET activity. Despite conveying clinical responses in MTC, MKIs have significant off-target activity causing marked toxicities limiting their effectiveness. Potent and selective RET inhibitors, selpercatinib and pralsetinib, demonstrate significant efficacy in RET-altered cancers and more tolerable side effect profiles than MKIs. However, durable responses can be limited by the acquisition of mutations which confer drug resistance to available treatments. Thus, development of more effective treatments for advanced, progressive MTC remains an urgent priority. In this chapter, we describe the current spectrum of systemic therapies for MTC, their limitations, and ongoing investigations.",Recent results in cancer research. Fortschritte der Krebsforschung.

Postoperative staging is used to separate low-risk patients from high-risk patients with MTC. In addition to the TNM system, further histological staging with Ki67, mitotic count, tumor necrosis, and molecular analysis of somatic RET mutations is helpful for the stratification of patients in different prognostic categories. The number of lymph node metastases and involved compartments as well as postoperative Ctn (calcitonin) and CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) levels should also be documented. Postoperative nonmeasurable Ctn levels are associated with a favorable outcome. In patients with basal serum Ctn levels less than 150 pg/ml following thyroidectomy, persistent or recurrent disease is almost always confined to lymph nodes in the neck. If the postoperative serum Ctn level exceeds 150 pg/ml, patients should be evaluated by imaging procedures, including neck and chest CT (computed tomography), contrast-enhanced MRI, US of the liver, bone scintigraphy, MRI of the bone and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. One can estimate the growth rate of MTC metastases from sequential imaging studies using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) that document increases in tumor size over time and by measuring serum levels of Ctn or CEA over multiple time points to determine the tumor marker doubling time. One of the main challenges remains finding effective adjuvant and palliative options for patients with metastatic disease. Patients with persistent or recurrent MTC localized to the neck and slightly elevated Ctn levels following thyroidectomy might be candidates for neck reoperations depending on the extent of the tumor. Once metastases appear, the clinician must decide which patients require therapy, balancing the frequently slow rate of tumor progression associated with a good quality of life and suggesting active surveillance against the limited efficacy and potential toxicities of local and systemic therapies. Considering that metastatic MTC is incurable, the management goals are to provide locoregional disease control, palliate symptoms such as diarrhea, palliate symptomatic metastases causing pain or bone fractures, and control metastases that threaten life through bronchial obstruction or spinal cord compression. This can be achieved by palliative surgery, EBRT (external beam radiation therapy) or systemic therapy using multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) targeting RET or selective RET inhibitors requiring genetic testing prior to the initiation of therapy.",Recent results in cancer research.

These patients are typically younger, non-smokers, and have non-squamous histology. Pralsetinib is a novel RET inhibitor that showed promising efficacy and tolerability in the ARROW trial. Due to the small percentage of patients that have RET mutated NSCLC, real world data on safety is still needed. Case report: This case report outlines a patient who was initiated on pralsetinib for RET mutated NSCLC and subsequently developed reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia and hepatitis B. Management and outcome: The patient was initiated on valganciclovir and entecavir with subsequent improvement in viral loads. They were able to reinitiate pralsetinib at a lower dose following improvement of CMV and hepatitis B viral load with continuation of entecavir. Discussion: RET is responsible for activation of several signaling paths including PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT. Those pathways are involved in the immune system. When reviewing current JAK inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors on the market, there is mixed data on HBV reactivation and CMV viremia, though theoretically possible. Therefore, this should be evaluated and addressed in further studies. The educational value of this case could provide valuable insights for baseline monitoring and management for similarly effected patients.",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,"Alanna Lehman, Anthony Perissinotti, Sam Aitken","Michigan Medicine, Clinical Pharmacist Specialist, Inpatient Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA Michigan Medicine, Clinical Pharmacist Specialist, Inpatient Hematology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA",English,"Pyridines; Cytomegalovirus Infections*/chemically induced/drug therapy/diagnosis/virology; Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use; Viremia*/chemically induced/drug therapy/diagnosis; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/drug therapy/genetics; Leucine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use; Humans; Lung Neoplasms*/drug therapy/genetics; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret*/genetics/antagonists & inhibitors; Pyrazoles*/adverse effects/therapeutic use; Pyrimidines*/therapeutic use/adverse effects; Virus Activation/drug effects; Hepatitis B*/drug therapy/chemically induced/diagnosis; Middle Aged",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39692337,,"CMV reactivation, NSCLC, Pralsetinib, hepatitis B reactivation","Lehman A, Perissinotti A, Aitken S.

These novel agents have improved outcomes by overcoming challenges posed by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and resistance mechanisms, enabling more effective treatment of BM. RECENT FINDINGS: In NSCLC, therapies such as osimertinib have improved efficacy in treating EGFR-mutant BM, with emerging combinations such as amivantamab and lazertinib offering promising alternatives for patients resistant to frontline therapies. In HER2-positive breast cancer, significant advancements with tucatinib and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) have transformed the treatment landscape, achieving improved survival and intracranial control in patients with BM. Similarly, in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), novel therapies such as sacituzumab govitecan (SG) and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) offer new hope for managing BM. For melanoma, the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and ipilimumab has proven effective in enhancing survival for patients with BM, both in BRAF-mutant and wild-type cases. Developing targeted therapies penetrating the BBB has revolutionized BM treatment by targeting key drivers like EGFR, ALK, HER2, and BRAF. Despite improved survival, challenges persist, particularly for patients with resistant genetic alterations. Future research should optimise combination therapies, overcome resistance, and refine treatment sequencing. Continued emphasis on personalized, biomarker-driven approaches offers the potential to further improve outcomes, even for complex cases.",Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports,"Vivek Podder, Tulika Ranjan, Maya Gowda, Alejandra M.

However, there is limited comprehensive safety information available for selpercatinib through large-scale post-marketing monitoring. METHODS: This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of selpercatinib-related adverse events (AEs) using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database. Four disproportionality methods were employed to identify potential AEs associated with selpercatinib. Specifically, this study investigated the differences in AEs of selpercatinib with respect to reporter continent, indication, sex, age, weight, dose, frequency, and onset time. RESULTS: A total of 464 reports and 1,007 selpercatinib-related AEs were identified. Three new significant AEs were discovered, including dysphagia, pericardial effusion, and hemiparesis. Notably, Asia reported hepatic function abnormal more frequently, especially in patient administered doses exceeding 160 mg. Furthermore, hypersensitivity was reported more frequently by Asia and in individuals weighing less than 50 kg. CONCLUSIONS: It is paramount to stay vigilant concerning the potential emergence of three newly identified AEs. Significant differences were found in selpercatinib-related AEs concerning reporter continent, sex, weight, dose, frequency, and onset time, which deserved clinical attention.

However, there is no evidence on the efficacy of pralsetinib as neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced RET-altered thyroid cancer. CASE REPORT: Two patients with locally advanced pappilary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) were treated with pralsetinib (400 mg daily) to reduce tumor size and increase the chance of R0 resection.

Currently, highly selective RET inhibitors have been approved for clinical use in patients with RET mutations with persistent, recurrent or metastatic disease. This therapy has proven efficacy, low toxicity, and a limited impact on patients' quality of life. However, for recurrent or metastatic RET-negative disease, few systemic therapies are available. Multikinase inhibitors are used; however, tumour cells frequently develop resistance mechanisms, or treatment must be discontinued due to the high incidence of side effects.

Current rare disease policy focuses more on strengthening the diagnostics and lacks a proper comprehensive treatment framework to ensure favorable clinical outcomes. Indian patients are largely excluded from global orphan drug clinical trials. This further alienates patients from access to rare disease treatment and available treatments come at high cost. This review-based study assesses the landscape of health policies and programs in India through a review of literature and guidelines, to identify strategic opportunities and recommendations for enhancing the overall care and support for the Rare Disease (RD) patient population and improving the orphan drug research ecosystem in India. Discussion: The absence of specific regulations, shortage of healthcare resources, budget constraints, competing health priorities, lack of patient data, and insufficient research incentives discourage orphan drug development and global clinical trial inclusion, resulting in treatment inaccessibility and high costs. The Indian Government introduced the National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases (NPRD) to address these challenges. Several initiatives have been introduced to attract stakeholders with government-funded research, grants, incentives, and accelerated regulatory approvals of novel therapies that can ensure timely prevention and treatment of rare diseases. The National RD Registry by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) aims to provide prevalence data. Innovative approaches are required to improve rare disease management and promote orphan drug research. This will ensure the accessibility and affordability of life-saving therapeutics for India’s rare disease patients. Conclusion: An integrated RD management and orphan drug research framework focusing on robust data management, patient-oriented policies to improve the treatment landscape, flexible regulations, strengthening rare disease registry with clinical and diagnostic data, and a favorable research ecosystem to promote indigenous research catering to the Indian population, will improve the treatment landscape and orphan drug research and development in India.

Previous data provide evidence that glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) restores epithelial integrity by largely undefined mechanisms. Here, we assessed the role of GDNF for mucosal healing. In dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)‐induced colitis in mice application of GDNF enhanced recovery as revealed by reduced disease activity index and histological inflammation scores. In biopsy‐based wounding experiments GDNF application in mice improved healing of the intestinal mucosa. GDNF‐induced epithelial recovery was also evident in wound assays from intestinal organoids and Caco2 cells. These observations were accompanied by an increased number of Ki67‐positive cells in vivo after GDNF treatment, which were present along elongated proliferative areas within the crypts. In addition, the intestinal stem cell marker and R‐spondin receptor LGR5 was significantly upregulated following GDNF treatment in all experimental models. The effects of GDNF on cell proliferation, LGR5 and Ki67 upregulation were blocked using the RET‐specific inhibitor BLU‐667. Downstream of RET‐phosphorylation, activation of Src kinase was involved to mediate GDNF effects. GDNF promotes intestinal wound healing by promoting cell proliferation. This is mediated by RET‐dependent activation of Src kinase with consecutive LGR5 upregulation, indicating activation of the stem cell niche.",Cell Proliferation,"Marius Hörner, Natalie Burkard, Matthias Kelm, Antonia Leist, Thekla Selig, Catherine Kollmann, Michael Meir, Christoph Otto, Christoph‐Thomas Germer, Kai Kretzschmar, Sven Flemming, Nicolas Schlegel","Department of General, Visceral Vascular and Pediatric Surgery University Hospital Wuerzburg Wuerzburg Germany Mildred Scheel Early Career Centre for Cancer Research Wuerzburg University Hospital Wuerzburg, MSNZ/IZKF Wuerzburg Germany",English,"Humans; Pyridines; Stem Cell Niche*/drug effects; Dextran Sulfate; Male; Caco-2 Cells; Mice; Colitis*/drug therapy/metabolism; Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor*/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Pyrazoles; Organoids; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/metabolism; Pyrimidines; Animals; Intestinal Mucosa*/drug effects; Mice, Inbred C57BL",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11839185,,,"Hörner M, Burkard N, Kelm M, Leist A, Selig T, Kollmann C, Meir M, Otto C, Germer C, Kretzschmar K, Flemming S, Schlegel N.

This study aimed to illustrate the efficacy and safety of selective RET inhibitors in a real-world clinical context in China. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring RET rearrangement and receiving RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RET-TKI) in the real world were enrolled in this retrospective study. Clinical data, including baseline clinicopathological information, efficacy parameters such as objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events (AEs), were collected from the electronic medical record system. The pattern of treatment failure of first-line RET-TKI was also described. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled in this study. RET-TKI induced an ORR of 73.1% and a median PFS (mPFS) of 22.7 months (95%CI, 11.7-33.7) in the first-line setting. The ORR and mPFS were 58.3% and 17.7 months (95%CI, 9.1-26.2), 55.6% and 14.7 months (95%CI, 12.6-16.8) in the second-line and later-line settings, respectively. No significant difference was observed among different application lines with respect to the ORR (P = 0.534) or PFS (P = 0.795). In the first-line setting, RET-TKI significantly prolonged PFS compared to other regimens including chemotherapy-based regimens, multikinase inhibitors and other systemic regimens without chemotherapy (P < 0.05). Poor ECOG performance status was related to shorter PFS (P = 0.018). The most common AEs of grade 3 or worse were a decreased neutrophil count (11.4%) and anemia (11.4%). No new AEs or grade 5 AEs were observed. Brain metastasis was one of the most common patterns of treatment failure. In patients with baseline brain metastasis, the intracranial ORR was 50%, and the DCR was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: RET-TKI had favorable efficacy and safety in real-world contexts in China and should be considered the preferred choice for first-line treatment in RET-rearranged NSCLC patients.",BMC Cancer,"Siyu Lei, Linyan Tian, Lu Yang, Yaning Yang, Junling Li, Xingsheng Hu, Xuezhi Hao, Haiyan Xu, Yan Wang",,English,"Middle Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/drug therapy/genetics/pathology/mortality; Retrospective Studies; Protein Kinase Inhibitors*/therapeutic use/adverse effects; China; Treatment Outcome; Biomedical and Life Sciences; Aged; Humans; Female; Lung Neoplasms*/drug therapy/genetics/pathology/mortality; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret*/genetics/antagonists & inhibitors; Aged, 80 and over; Male; Adult; Gene Rearrangement",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11577726,,"RET rearrangement, Non-small cell lung cancer, RET-TKI, Real-world study","Lei S, Tian L, Yang L, Yang Y, Li J, Hu X, Hao X, Xu H, Wang Y.

This is in part due to the advent of molecular profiling, which has highlighted molecularly-distinct subsets of pts, especially those with KRAS wild-type disease. We now know that these pts harbor genomic alterations that not only serve as molecular drivers but also pose as therapeutically relevant markers. In the absence of strong evidence to support the use of targeted therapy in the front-line setting, we continue to offer chemotherapy for treatment-naïve pts. However, an argument can be made for the front-line use of targeted therapy in pts who are not fit for chemotherapy or who are not interested in it. The challenge is ensuring that molecular profiling is done in a timely fashion to prevent significant delays in therapy. In our practice, we offer molecular testing to all pts with a new diagnosis of advanced PDAC. We prefer the utility of targeted therapy in the second line and beyond for pts who have an actionable target, over the use of further chemotherapy, as targeted therapy appears to confer deep and durable responses and longer survival. For pts with MSI-H or MMRd disease, the use of immunotherapy is indicated, although it has to be noted that MSI-H/MMRd PDAC performed worse that other MSI-H/MMRd cancers treated with immunotherapy. Therefore, in the presence of MSI-H/MMRd and an additional actionable target, we prefer treating with targeted therapy and reserving immunotherapy for later lines.

We evaluate the efficacy and applicability of targeted therapies and immunotherapies, exploring their potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and improve patient outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and ADCs effectively treat BM. These treatments can overcome the challenges posed by the blood-brain barrier and improve therapeutic outcomes. ADCs are promising because they can deliver cytotoxic agents directly to tumor cells, which reduces systemic toxicity and increases drug delivery efficiency to the brain. Personalized medicine is becoming increasingly significant in treatment decisions, with biomarkers playing an essential role. Advances in molecular genetics and drug development have led to more refined treatments, emphasizing the precision medicine framework. The management of BM is evolving, driven by drug efficacy, resistance mechanisms, and the need for personalized medicine. Integrating ADCs into treatment regimens represents a significant advancement in targeting metastatic brain tumors. Despite these advances, BM management still presents considerable challenges, requiring ongoing research and multi-institutional trials to optimize therapeutic strategies. This review outlines the current state and future directions in treating BM, highlighting the critical need for continued innovation and comprehensive clinical evaluations to improve survival rates and quality of life for affected patients.",Current Oncology Reports,"Vivek Podder, Shreyas Bellur, Kim Margolin, Pooja Advani, Reshma L.

The review delves into a critical assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of targeted RET inhibitors, while also scrutinizing the diverse array of treatment modalities employed in the Chinese patient population. METHODS: The study conducted a comprehensive review of the advancements made by Chinese scholars in the realm of RET driver genes. It delved into the analysis of the incidence of RET rearrangements in solid tumors, alongside an examination of the varied treatment paradigms and their current status within China. Utilizing the RECIST 1.1 criteria, the study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy achieved in RET-positive NSCLC patients undergoing diverse treatment modalities. Furthermore, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were meticulously graded following the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). RESULTS: A retrospective, multi-center, real-world analysis was conducted, encompassing 64 patients diagnosed with pathologically confirmed RET rearrangement advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between December 2015 and November 2023. Notably, KIF5B-RET emerged as the most prevalent RET fusion partner, accounting for 59.4% of cases. Therapeutic interventions among these patients included specific targeted inhibitors such as Pralsetinib (48.4%), chemotherapy (34.3%), multi-target inhibitors (15.6%), and one case (1.6%) involving immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy. In terms of progression-free survival (PFS), Pralsetinib monotherapy demonstrated a median PFS of 16.03 months, outperforming chemotherapy (2.87 months; p < 0.0001), chemotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic therapy (6.90 months; p = 0.048), and multi-target inhibitors (2.50 months; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the one-year and two-year overall survival (OS) rates for Pralsetinib monotherapy were 64.3% and 46.4%, respectively. Regarding safety, 71.0% of patients receiving Pralsetinib experienced at least one adverse event, with 45.2% classified as grade 3-4 in severity. Notably, no fatalities were attributed to adverse events. Common adverse events included hemoglobin reduction (35.5%) and neutropenia (32.3%), indicative of an overall favorable safety profile for Pralsetinib in this patient population. CONCLUSION: This study encapsulates the research endeavors and treatment advancements of RET rearrangement solid tumors within the Chinese healthcare landscape, specifically highlighting the diverse real-world therapeutic approaches and their effectiveness in managing advanced RET rearrangement NSCLC among Chinese patients.

However, some patients with RET-aberrant cancer are insensitive to RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Recently, drug-tolerant mechanisms have attracted attention as targets for initial therapies to overcome drug resistance. The underlying mechanisms of drug-tolerant cell emergence treated with RET-TKIs derived from RET-aberrant cancer cells remain unknown. This study investigated the role of YAP-mediated HER3 signaling in the underlying mechanisms of adaptive resistance to RET-TKIs in RET-aberrant cancer cells. Experimental Design:: Four RET-aberrant cancer cell lines were used to assess sensitivity to the RET-TKIs selpercatinib and pralsetinib and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive resistance using RNA sequencing, phospho–receptor tyrosine kinase antibody arrays, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and luciferase reporter assays. Clinical specimens from patients with RET fusion–positive lung cancer were analyzed for pretreatment YAP expression and correlated with treatment outcomes. Results:: In high YAP-expressing RET-aberrant cancer cells, YAP-mediated HER3 signaling activation maintained cell survival and induced the emergence of cells tolerant to the RET-TKIs selpercatinib and pralsetinib. The pan-ErBB inhibitor afatinib and YAP/tea domain inhibitors verteporfin and K-975 sensitized YAP-expressing RET-aberrant cancer cells to the RET-TKIs selpercatinib and pralsetinib. Pretreatment YAP expression in clinical specimens obtained from patients with RET fusion–positive lung cancer was associated with poor RET-TKI treatment outcomes. Conclusions:: The YAP–HER3 axis is crucial for the survival and adaptive resistance of high YAP-expressing RET-aberrant cancer cells treated with RET-TKIs.

We conducted a first-in-human phase 1 study on SY-5007, a potent and selective RET inhibitor, in patients with RET-altered solid tumors. Primary endpoints were safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity. A total of 122 patients were enrolled (17 in dose-escalation phase and 105 in dose-expansion phase), including 91 with non-small cell lung cancer, 23 with medullary thyroid cancer, 7 with papillary thyroid cancer and 1 with gastric cancer. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 96.7% of patients, with the most common grade ≥ 3 TRAEs being hypertension (22.1%), diarrhea (16.4%), hypertriglyceridemia (6.6%), and neutropenia (6.6%). The exposure to SY-5007 was dose proportional. Among the 116 efficacy-evaluable patients, the overall objective response rate (ORR) was 57.8%, with 70.0% in treatment-naïve patients and 51.3% in previously treated patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 21.1 months. Efficacy was observed regardless of tumor types and previous therapies. Biomarker analysis of 61 patients with circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-detectable RET alterations showed an ORR of 57.4% and median PFS of 13.8 months. Rapid ctDNA clearance of RET alteration correlated with faster responses and improved outcomes. In relapsed patients, off-target induced resistance was observed in 57.1% (12/21), with no on-target RET alterations identified. In conclusion, SY-5007 was well-tolerated and showed promising efficacy in patients with RET-altered solid tumors. Serial ctDNA monitoring may unveil treatment response and potential resistance mechanisms (NCT05278364).",Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy,"Wei Li, Yongsheng Wang, Anwen Xiong, Ge Gao, Zhengbo Song, Yiping Zhang, Dingzhi Huang, Feng Ye, Qiming Wang, Zhihui Li, Jiaye Liu, Chunwei Xu, Yinghui Sun, Xijie Liu, Fei Zhou, Caicun Zhou",,English,"Middle Aged; Aged; Humans; Female; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine/drug therapy/genetics/pathology; Thyroid Cancer, Papillary/drug therapy/genetics/pathology; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret*/genetics/antagonists & inhibitors; Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/pathology; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/genetics/pathology; Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/pathology; Male; Maximum Tolerated Dose; Thyroid Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/pathology; Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics; Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/adverse effects/pharmacology; Aged, 80 and over; Adult; Medicine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11532403,,,"Li W, Wang Y, Xiong A, Gao G, Song Z, Zhang Y, Huang D, Ye F, Wang Q, Li Z, Liu J, Xu C, Sun Y, Liu X, Zhou F, Zhou C.

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of selpercatinib versus chemotherapy and pembrolizumab in the first-line treatment of RET fusion-positive NSCLC from the perspective of the United States (US) payer. METHOD: A partitioned survival model was developed based on data from the LIBRETTO-431 trial. Cost and utility values for the health state were obtained from database data or published literature. The measured outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the model. RESULTS: Selpercatinib increased QALYs in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC by 0.90 compared to chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab, with an additional cost of $542,517.45, resulting in an ICER of $603,286.49/QALY, which exceeded the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold ($150,000) in the US. One-way sensitivity analysis suggested that the utility of progressed disease, the utility of progression-free survival, the price of selpercatinib, the discount, the price of pemetrexed, and the price of pembrolizumab had the greatest influence on the cost- effectiveness analysis process. In the PSA, 99.9% of the scatter points were distributed above the US WTP threshold of $150,000.

MTC include hereditary and sporadic cases, the former derived from a germline mutation of rearrangement during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene, whereas somatic RET mutations are frequently present in the latter. Surgery is the standard treatment for early stage MTC, and the 10-year survival rate of early MTC is over 80%. While for metastatic MTC, chemotherapy showing low response rate, and there was a lack of effective systemic therapies in the past. Due to the high risk (ca. 15-20%) of distant metastasis and limited systemic therapies, the 10-year survival rate of patients with advanced MTC was only 10-40% from the time of first metastasis. Over the past decade, targeted therapy for RET has developed rapidly, bringing hopes to patients with advanced and progressive MTC. Two multi-kinase inhibitors (MKIs) including Cabozantinib and Vandetanib have been shown to increase progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with metastatic MTC and have been approved as choices of first-line treatment. However, these MKIs have not prolonged overall survival (OS) and their utility is limited due to high rates of off-target toxicities. Recently, new generation TKIs, including Selpercatinib and Pralsetinib, have demonstrated highly selective efficacy against RET and more favorable side effect profiles, and gained approval as second-line treatment options. Despite the ongoing development of RET inhibitors, the management of advanced and progressive MTC remains challenging, drug resistance remains the main reason for treatment failure, and the mechanisms are still unclear. Besides, new promising therapeutic approaches, such as novel drug combinations and next generation RET inhibitors are under development.

It also discusses the main biomarkers involved in this disease, such as PD-L1, HER − 2, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Claudin 18.2, FGFR2, and the current standard and targeted therapies. Molecular testing for these changes is gaining significance in the context of gastric cancer. By incorporating detailed biomarker analysis into clinical practice, we can provide more effective and personalized treatment options, ultimately improving clinical management and enhancing survival rates for gastric cancer patients.",Surgical and Experimental Pathology,"Marina Nishimuni, Laura Carolina Lopez Claro, Maria Ignez Freitas Melro Braghiroli",,English,Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42047-024-00162-4,,,"Nishimuni M, Claro LCL, Braghiroli MIFM.

However, real-world data on RET biomarker testing and treatment patterns in China remain limited. This study aimed to examine demographics, clinical and molecular features, and RET testing and treatment patterns and outcomes in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC. METHODS: Utilizing real-world data from the Chinese Multi-center Lung Cancer Precision Medicine Registry, this retrospective cohort study focused on Chinese patients diagnosed with RET fusion-positive NSCLC between January 1, 2016, and November 30, 2021. The cohort was divided into early-stage and advanced-stage subgroups. Demographics, clinical and molecular profiles, treatment received, and outcomes including real-world event free survival (rwEFS), real-world progression free survival (rwPFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. RESULTS: The study included 121 patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC, comprising 80 early-stage and 58 advanced-stage patients. High biomarker testing rates were observed at diagnosis (75% for early-stage, 78% for advanced-stage). RET testing was often conducted via tissue samples (95.9%) and next-generation sequencing (89.3%). KIF5B (57.0%) and CCDC6 (20.7%) were the most common gene fusion partners. The most frequent oncogenic mutations were TP53 (15.7%) and EGFR (6.6%). Platinum-based chemotherapy was the most common first-line treatment among advanced-stage patients. Median rwPFS was 9.22 months for advanced-stage patients on first-line chemotherapy, and median OS was 30.7 months for all advanced-stage patients. The 2-year rwEFS rate for early-stage patients was 86.0%, with a median OS of 91.9 months. CONCLUSIONS: The study observed high biomarker testing rates at initial diagnosis for early- and advanced-stage RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients in China. The heterogeneous treatment pattern of advanced patients suggests the need for more precise, evidence-based treatment to guide clinical decisions. Given the existing therapeutic regimens fall short of adequately addressing treatment needs, targeted therapies are essential to improve outcomes.",Advances in Therapy,"Shun Lu, Lan Shen, Qiming Wang, Haiyang Chen, Yi Zhao, Ying Li, Grace Segall, Manoj Khanal, Xue Zhang, Ding Ding, Jingxin Shao, Long Pang",,English,"Medicine; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Aged; Humans; Female; Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics; Lung Neoplasms*/genetics/drug therapy/therapy/diagnosis; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/genetics/drug therapy/therapy; Male; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret*/genetics; China/epidemiology; Adult",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39316291,,"RET fusions, Diagnosis patterns, Non-small cell lung cancer, Real-world context, Treatment patterns","Lu S, Shen L, Wang Q, Chen H, Zhao Y, Li Y, Segall G, Khanal M, Zhang X, Ding D, Shao J, Pang L.

However, the correlation between genetic mutations and clinical features remains to be established. Therefore, this study aimed to retrospectively analyze major genetic mutations, specifically BRAF mutations and RET rearrangements, and develop a treatment algorithm by comparing background and clinical characteristics. METHOD: One hundred thirteen patients with primary PTC were included in this study. BRAF mutations were detected via Sanger sequencing and RET rearrangements were detected via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patients were categorized into two groups based on the presence of BRAF mutations and RET rearrangements and their clinical characteristics (age, sex, TNM, stage, extratumoral extension, tumor size, unifocal/multifocal lesions, vascular invasion, differentiation, chronic thyroiditis, preoperative serum thyroglobulin level, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake) were compared subsequently. RESULT: After excluding unanalyzable specimens, 80 PTC patients (22 males and 58 females, mean age: 57.2 years) were included in the study. RET rearrangements were positive in 8 cases (10%), and BRAF mutation was positive in 63 (78.6%). The RET rearrangement group was significantly associated with younger age (p = 0.024), multifocal lesion (p = 0.048), distant metastasis (p = 0.025) and decreased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake (p < 0.001). The BRAF mutation group was significantly associated with unifocal lesions (p = 0.02) and increased 18F-FDG uptake (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: In this study, an increase in M classification cases was found in the RET rearrangements group. However, genetic mutations were not associated with the clinical stage, and no factors that could be incorporated into the treatment algorithm were identified.",Thyroid Research,"Daisuke Uno, Kazuhira Endo, Tomomi Yoshikawa, Nobuyuki Hirai, Eiji Kobayashi, Yosuke Nakanishi, Satoru Kondo, Tomokazu Yoshizaki",,English,Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11404047,,"BRAF mutation, Genetic mutations, Papillary thyroid carcinoma, RET rearrangements","Uno D, Endo K, Yoshikawa T, Hirai N, Kobayashi E, Nakanishi Y, Kondo S, Yoshizaki T.

In recent years, redifferentiation has emerged as an attractive approach for patients with RAI-R DTC, a strategy to induce iodine uptake in RAI-R DTC tumor cells and ultimately prolong time to initiation of systemic therapy. METHODS: An overview and critical appraisal of the existing literature on redifferentiation will be presented in this review under the lens of the genotype-specific targeted therapy administered with redifferentiation intent.

Lately, another modality which might provide significant information preoperatively on the aggressiveness of a thyroid tumor, its prognosis, and its recurrence rate is molecular testing. We reviewed the literature with regard to the role of preoperative molecular testing in patients with Bethesda V and Bethesda VI thyroid nodules and its impact on choice of the optimal treatment strategy. Several molecular mutations and alterations are associated with thyroid cancer and its biological behavior, such as BRAF-V600E, RET, and TERT promoter. Although the value of preoperative molecular testing for indeterminate nodules (Bethesda III and Bethesda IV) have been analyzed in numerous studies, the impact of preoperative molecular testing on Bethesda V and Bethesda VI thyroid nodules is not adequately described in the current literature. The preoperative recognition of specific molecular mutations, such as BRAFV600E and TERT promoter mutation, might provide more individualized management for thyroid cancer patients by altering the surgical approach and the extent of surgery for patients diagnosed with a more aggressive or iodine-resistant subtype of thyroid cancer.Thyroid cancer is characterized by multiple genetic mutations and alterations and, as a result, preoperative molecular testing of malignant nodules could be a very useful tool for surgeons, enabling them to decide on the most appropriate surgical approach for each patient.","Hormones (Athens, Greece)","Anna Paspala, Georgia Bompetsi, Stavroula A.

Understanding the fundamental pathophysiology of MTC is essential for clinical management. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is a powerful tool for identifying distinct cell types, offering a new biological foundation for comprehending the MTC ecosystem and developing precise treatment. Methods: Formalin fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of primary and adjacent non-cancerous tissues of three MTC cases were collected, and single-cell transcriptome data of MTC were obtained by using scRNA-seq technology. Annotated cell subpopulations were categorized and functionally enriched by principal component analysis, differential gene expression, and cell clustering analysis, to explore the biological process of tumor evolution that may be involved in each cell subpopulation. The copy number variation (CNV) profile was used to distinguish the malignancy of parafollicular thyroid cells, and the evolutionary trajectories of normal cells and tumor cells were revealed by the proposed time series analysis. The highly expressed genes in each cell subpopulation were analyzed by the FindAllMarker function of Seurat software, and verified by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The prognostic value of specific cell subtypes was validated using large-scale public datasets. Results: A total of 32,544 cells were obtained from the MTC tissue samples and 11,751 cells from the adjacent non-cancerous samples, which were classified into 7 heterogenous subpopulations by using R package of Seurat module. Copy number variations (CNVs) were significantly higher in tumor tissues than in adjacent non-tumor samples, predominantly enriched in subtypes C2 and C4. In addition, the pseudo-time for trajectory analysis suggested that the evolution of MTC tumor cells might begin with the C2 subtype, then transition to the early cancer subgroup C3, and further differentiate into four major malignant cell subpopulations C0, C1, C5 and C6. Survival analysis of a thyroid cancer cohort using the TCGA dataset revealed that high expression of genes linked to the C0 subcluster was correlated with poorer overall survival compared to low expression. Immunohistochemical staining showed that MAP3K4 was highly expressed in MTC tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Fluorescence in situ hybridization also confirmed the amplification of these two genes in MTC samples. Conclusions: By conducting scRNA-seq on FFPE samples, we mapped the single-cell transcriptome of MTC, uncovering the tumor heterogeneity and unique biological features of each cellular subpopulation. The biological roles of identified tumor cell subpopulations such as C0 and C3 subtypes of parafollicular cells suggested the potential to discover new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for MTC, providing valuable insights for future translational and clinical research.",Holistic Integrative Oncology,"Li-feng Wang, Wen-wen Zhou, Fang Yuan, Kai-wen Fu, Yongpeng He, Rui Chen",,English,Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s44178-024-00116-6,,,"Wang L, Zhou W, Yuan F, Fu K, He Y, Chen R.

This study aimed to characterize the cardiovascular toxicities associated with selective RET-TKI in real-world settings. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database from 1 January 2020 to 30 June 2023, were analyzed. Two disproportionality methods, information component and reporting odds ratio (ROR) were used. RESULTS: Both pralsetinib and selpercatinib showed positive signals for hypertension (pralsetinib: ROR: 5.25, 95% CI: 4.40-6.26; selpercatinib: ROR: 2.68, 95% CI: 1.87-3.82). Additionally, pralsetinib showed a positive signal for ischemic heart disease (ROR: 3.92, 95% CI: 2.94-5.23), and selpercatinib for torsade de pointes/QT prolongation (ROR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.74-4.04). The median time to onset(TTO) of cardiovascular toxicities was 33 days (IQR: 9-73 days) for pralsetinib and 15 days (IQR: 10-50 days) for selpercatinib. The proportion of deaths, life-threatening events, and hospitalizations due to cardiovascular toxicities were 8.57%, 1.19%, and 31.43%, respectively, for total selective RET-TKI.

Their prevalence varies considerably depending on demographics such as age and sex as well as the presence of risk factors. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the prevalence, risk stratification and current management strategies for thyroid nodules, with a particular focus on changes in diagnostic and therapeutic protocols that have occurred over the past 10 years. Several sonography-based stratification systems (such as Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (TIRADS)) might help to predict the malignancy risk of nodules, potentially eliminating the need for biopsy in many instances. However, large or suspicious nodules necessitate cytological evaluation following fine-needle aspiration biopsy for accurate classification. In the case of cytology yielding indeterminate results, additional tools, such as molecular testing, can assist in guiding the management plan. Surgery is no longer the only treatment for symptomatic or malignant nodules: active surveillance or local ablative treatments might be beneficial for appropriately selected patients. To enhance clinician-patient interactions and discussions about diagnostic options, shared decision-making tools have been developed.

It is a spectrum of different diseases, ranging from very indolent to lethal tumors. Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma (DTC), the most common thyroid malignancy, has often an excellent prognosis, but some patients develop metastatic Radioiodine-Refractory disease (RAIR) that cannot be controlled locally. In this setting, and for patients with metastatic Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) and Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma (ATC), systemic treatment with non-selective Multikinase Inhibitors (MKIs) is often employed to improve survival rates and quality of life. The molecular characterization of thyroid cancer showed that the main drivers of thyroid carcinogenesis not only correlate with morphological and clinical features but can be targeted by some modern and highly selective Kinase Inhibitors: vemurafenib and dabrafenib for carcinomas with BRAF V600E mutation, including Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC) and its subtypes; dabrafenib in association with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib for BRAF V600E-mutant ATC; larotrectinib and entrectinib for thyroid carcinomas with NTRK fusions and selpercatinib and pralsetinib for MTC with RET point mutations and DTC with RET-fusions. Apart of those markers, Microsatellite Instability status (MSI), Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and PD1/PD-L1 assessment have been explored in thyroid tumors, although immunotherapy for ATC has shown only modest results.

Tissue material underwent an internal validation phase followed by an external testing phase. The internal validation phase served as a cross-validation step conducted by panel institutes. In the external testing phase, the number of participating institutes in the RET point mutation sub-scheme, RET fusion (ISH) sub-scheme, and RET fusion (NGS) sub-scheme was 32, 24, and 38, respectively.

We discuss key contentious aspects of their treatment, such as the optimal timing for initiating systemic therapy, the choice of first-line medications, the appropriate timing for requesting molecular interrogation, and the challenges associated with accessing these drugs and molecular panels. METHODS: To illustrate these challenges and enhance understanding, we present five real clinical cases from the authors' experiences. RESULTS: Patients with Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) generally have an excellent prognosis, with an overall 10-year survival rate exceeding 97%. However, approximately 5% of DTC patients, especially those with distant metastases, may develop radioiodine-refractory disease, reducing survival rates. Access to medications remains difficult and time-consuming, particularly for patients within the public healthcare system. Urgent discussions on drug pricing involving all stakeholders are imperative. To break free from complacency, stakeholders must prioritize patient well-being by advocating for evidence-based drug pricing, increased participation in clinical trials, and streamlined regulatory processes. CONCLUSION: Beyond the recognized need for prospective randomized clinical trials to determine the optimal first-line drug and the timing of molecular testing, this type of manuscript plays a pivotal role in stimulating discussions and disseminating comprehensive knowledge about the challenges associated with treating and monitoring patients with radioiodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma, especially in developing countries.",Endocrine,"G.

The clinical drug development of RET inhibitors in RET fusion-positive lung cancers naturally began after RET fusions were first identified in patient tumor samples in 2011, and thereafter paralleled drug development in RET fusion-positive thyroid cancers. Multikinase inhibitors were initially tested with limited efficacy and substantial toxicity. RET inhibitors were then designed with improved selectivity, central nervous system penetrance, and activity against RET fusions and most RET mutations, including resistance mutations. Owing their success to these rationally designed features, the first-generation selective RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) had higher response rates, more durable disease control, and an improved safety profile compared to the multikinase inhibitors. This led to lung and thyroid cancer, and later tumor-agnostic regulatory approvals. While next-generation RET TKIs were designed to abrogate uncommon on-target (e.g., solvent front mutation) resistance to selpercatinib and pralsetinib, many of these drugs lacked the selectivity of the first-generation TKIs, raising the question of what the future holds for drug development in RET-dependent cancers.",Drugs,"Monica F.

With the introduction of novel diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, including targeted molecular therapies, the diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of thyroid carcinoma has rapidly evolved in recent decades following the development of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines in 2015. This review summarizes the current surveillance tools and treatment pathways for patients with various subtypes of thyroid carcinoma, including differentiated thyroid carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.Recent Findings: Advances in patient-tailored therapies, such as immunotherapeutic agents, diagnostic modalities, and risk stratification tools help to promote personalized medicine for patients with thyroid carcinoma with the goal to minimize over-treatment of low-risk thyroid disease and under-treatment of high-risk thyroid disease.Summary: The management of thyroid carcinoma is constantly evolving with the advent of new diagnostic modalities and management options, including targeted therapy treatments, all of which help to enhance patient-centered care and emphasize the importance of patient-tailored surgical and medical therapies. While existing guidelines create a foundation upon which current treatment algorithms are rooted, several novel therapeutic strategies have emerged that have not only improved overall survival, but also pushed the boundary of what is known of the molecular landscape of thyroid carcinoma. These continuing improvements, in conjunction with surgical management, pave the way for creating treatment methods that will further transform care of thyroid carcinoma patients and improve quality of life for these patients.",Current Surgery Reports,"Kirsten Lung, Isheeta Madeka, Alliric I.

Here we show that tumor evolution can be reproducibly redirected to engineer therapeutic opportunity, regardless of the exact ensemble of pre-existing genetic heterogeneity. We develop a selection gene drive system that is stably introduced into cancer cells and is composed of two genes, or switches, that couple an inducible fitness advantage with a shared fitness cost. Using stochastic models of evolutionary dynamics, we identify the design criteria for selection gene drives. We then build prototypes that harness the selective pressure of multiple approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors and employ therapeutic mechanisms as diverse as prodrug catalysis and immune activity induction. We show that selection gene drives can eradicate diverse forms of genetic resistance in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that model-informed switch engagement effectively targets pre-existing resistance in mouse models of solid tumors. These results establish selection gene drives as a powerful framework for evolution-guided anticancer therapy.",Nature Biotechnology,"Scott M. Leighow, Joshua A.

Differentiated, poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas originate in the follicular cells, while medullary carcinomas derive from the C‑cells. The prognosis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma is generally very favourable after surgery and radioiodine therapy. Where tumours progress and lose the ability to enrich iodine, curative treatment is usually not possible. A strategy of watchful waiting is often appropriate. Activating mutations in BRAF or gene fusions of RET and NTRK provide opportunities for targeted therapies. These may be applied with the aim of restoring iodine uptake (redifferentiation). In the absence of molecular therapy targets, multityrosine kinase inhibitors (MKI) are the therapy of choice. If anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is suspected, rapid diagnostic workup including molecular pathology is warranted. Surgery where possible and radiochemotherapy are essential components of therapy. In the presence of a BRAF mutation, inhibition of BRAF and MEK is effective, even if it is not approved in Germany. Where molecular targets are lacking, combination therapy with the MKI lenvatinib and immune checkpoint inhibition is highly effective. Mutations in RET are present in the vast majority of cases of medullary thyroid carcinoma. In aggressive advanced disease, selective RET inhibition has recently been approved as first-line therapy and often leads to an objective response and long-lasting disease stabilisation. In summary, thyroid carcinomas are among the tumour entities for which molecularly targeted therapies can be used most frequently. The involvement of specialised centres is advisable.","Innere Medizin (Heidelberg, Germany)","Tim Brandenburg, Matthias Kroiß","Klinik für Endokrinologie, Diabetologie und Stoffwechsel, Universitätsklinikum Essen, Hufelandstraße 55, 45147, Essen, Deutschland. tim.brandenburg@uk-essen.de.

In order to analyze whether pralsetinib takes effect in Rearranged during Transfection (RET)-positive patients with central nervous system metastasis, we aimed to develop a method for the detection of pralsetinib concentrations in human plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) by UPLC-MS/MS. Methods:: The method was developed using the external standard method, and method validation included precision, accuracy, stability, extraction recovery, and matrix effect. Working solutions were all obtained based on stock solutions of pralsetinib of 1mg/mL. The plasma/CSF samples were precipitated by acetonitrile for protein precipitation and then separated on an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1×100 mm, 1.8 μm) with a gradient elution using 0.1% formic acid (solution A) and acetonitrile (solution B) as mobile phases at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The tandem mass spectrometry was performed by a triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry system (QTRAPTM 6500+) with an electrospray ion (ESI) source and Analyst 1.7.2 data acquisition system. Data were collected in Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) and positive ionization mode. Results:: A good linear relationship of pralsetinib in both plasma and CSF was successfully established, and the calibration ranges were found to be 1.0-64.0 μg/mL and 50.0ng/mL-12.8 μg/mL for pralsetinib in the plasma and CSF, respectively. Validation was performed, including calibration assessment, selectivity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, extraction recovery, and stability, and all results have been found to be acceptable. The method has been successfully applied to pralsetinib concentration detection in a clinical sample, and the concentrations have been found to be 475 ng/mL and 61.55 μg/mL in the CSF and plasma, respectively. Conclusion:: We have developed a quick and effective method for concentration detection in both plasma and CSF, and it can be applied for drug monitoring in clinical practice. The method can also provide a reference for further optimization.",Anti-Cancer Agents in Medicinal Chemistry,"Zichen Zhao, Qianlun Pu, Tonglin Sun, Qian Huang, Liping Tong, Ting Fan, Jingyue Kang, Yuhong Chen, Yan Zhang","Lung Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; Division of Medical Oncology, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China Advanced Mass Spectrometry Center, Research Core Facility, Frontiers Science Center for Disease-related Molecular Network, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China",English,"Antineoplastic Agents/blood/cerebrospinal fluid; Pyrimidines; Pyridines; Drug Monitoring*/methods; Pyrazoles; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Humans; Pyrroles/cerebrospinal fluid/blood/chemistry; Protein Kinase Inhibitors/cerebrospinal fluid/blood/chemistry; Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Tandem Mass Spectrometry*; Molecular Structure",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38584556,,"Pralsetinib, UPLC-MS/MS, cerebrospinal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)., plasma, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry","Zhao Z, Pu Q, Sun T, Huang Q, Tong L, Fan T, Kang J, Chen Y, Zhang Y.

However, adjuvant-targeted therapy remains controversial for some NSCLC patients carrying rare gene mutations such as RET, as there is currently a lack of confirmed randomized controlled trials demonstrating efficacy. In this report, we describe the case of a 58-year-old man with stage IIIA NSCLC who underwent complete lobectomy with selective lymph node dissection. Postoperative next-generation sequencing revealed that the patient harbored a rare KIF13A-RET fusion. The patient elected to receive adjuvant treatment with pralsetinib monotherapy and underwent serial circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) monitoring after surgery. During follow-up, despite experiencing dose reduction and irregular medication adherence, the patient still achieved a satisfactory disease-free survival (DFS) of 27 months. Furthermore, ctDNA predicted tumor recurrence 4 months earlier than imaging techniques. The addition of bevacizumab to the original regimen upon recurrence continued to be beneficial. Pralsetinib demonstrated promising efficacy as adjuvant therapy, while ctDNA analysis offered a valuable tool for early detection of tumor recurrence. By leveraging targeted therapies and innovative monitoring techniques, we aim to improve outcomes and quality of life for NSCLC patients in the future.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)","Zenghao Chang, Tengfei Zhu, Hao Jiang, Wei Ou, Siyu Wang","Department of Thoracic Surgery, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510062, China",English,"Humans; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics; Pyrazoles/therapeutic use; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/drug therapy/genetics; Pyridines; Male; Circulating Tumor DNA/genetics; Kinesins*/genetics; Pyrimidinones/therapeutic use; Lung Neoplasms*/drug therapy/genetics; Middle Aged; Pyrimidines",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11275379,,"NSCLC, RET fusion, adjuvant treatment, case report, ctDNA, pralsetinib","Chang Z, Zhu T, Jiang H, Ou W, Wang S.

The dose of an investigational product is chosen considering the compound information available to date, feasibility of the assessments, regulatory requirements, and the intent to maximize information for later regulatory submission. This review selected 37 programs as case examples of recently approved drugs to explore the doses selected with focus on studies of drug interaction, renal and hepatic impairment, food effect and concentration-QTc assessment.The review found that regulatory agencies may consider alternative approaches if justified and safe as illustrated in these examples. It is thus recommendable to use the first in human trial as an opportunity to assess QT-prolongation and drug interactions using probes or endogenous markers while maximizing the DDI potential, increasing sensitivity and ensuring safety. Early understanding of dose proportionality assists dose finding and simple and fast to conduct DDI study designs are advantageous. Single dose impairment studies despite non-proportional/time-dependent PK are often acceptability.Overall, the early understanding of the drug's safety profile is essential to ensure the safety of doses selected while preventing clinical trials with unnecessary exposure when using high doses or multiple doses.

As the nonselective nature of these inhibitors, patients have off-target adverse effects. The discovery of highly potent selective RET inhibitors such as pralsetinib and selpercatinib improve the clinic efficiency and more favorable toxicity profile. However, acquired resistance mediated by secondary mutations in the solvent-front region of the kinase (e.g. G810C/S/R) become a new challenge for selective RET inhibitor therapies.

Correlation between genotype and phenotype has not been comprehensively described. This study aimed to describe the genomic landscape of DSPTC comprehensively using next-generation sequencing (NGS), analyze the prognostic implications of different mutations, and identify potential molecular treatment targets. METHODS: Tumor tissue was available for 41 DSPTC patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2004 and 2021. After DNA extraction, NGS was performed using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets platform, which sequences 505 critical cancer genes. Clinicopathologic characteristics were compared using the chi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank statistics were used to compare outcomes. RESULTS: The most common mutation was RET fusion, occurring in 32% (13/41) of the patients. Other oncologic drivers occurred in 68% (28/41) of the patients, including 8 BRAFV600E mutations (20%) and 4 USP8 mutations (10%), which have not been described in thyroid malignancy previously. Patients experienced RET fusion-positive tumors at a younger age than other drivers, with more aggressive histopathologic features and more advanced T stage (p = 0.019). Patients who were RET fusion-positive had a significantly poorer 5-year recurrence-free survival probability than those with other drivers (46% vs 84%; p = 0.003; median follow-up period, 45 months). In multivariable analysis, RET fusion was the only independent risk factor for recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 7.69; p = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Gene-sequencing should be strongly considered for recurrent DSPTC due to significant prognostic and treatment implications of RET fusion identification. The novel finding of USP8 mutation in DSPTC requires further investigation into its potential as a driver mutation.",Annals of Surgical Oncology,"Daniel W. Scholfield, Conall W. R.

Additionally, to compare: (i) ORR and PFS among patients treated with lenvatinib and sorafenib; (ii) ORR and PFS among patients receiving lenvatinib as first-line vs. second-line and; (iii) adverse effects (AEs) observed in patients treated with these medications. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of RR-DTC adult patients treated with TKIs at the Division of Endocrinology, Hospital de Clinicas, University of Buenos Aires (March 2011-November 2023). RESULTS: Among 43 patients included in the study, 32 received sorafenib (30 as first-line and 2 as second-line), while 29 received lenvatinib (12 as first-line and 17 as second-line). The median PFS and OS for the entire cohort were 32.7 and 39.0 months, respectively. Lenvatinib demonstrated a significantly higher ORR compared to sorafenib (37.9% vs. 9.4%, p = 0.008). However, both drugs exhibited similar median PFS (23.2 vs. 16.0 months, p = 0.419). No significant difference was observed in ORR and PFS between patients receiving first-line vs. second-line lenvatinib. Sorafenib-treated patients experienced higher rates of hand-foot skin syndrome (69% vs. 41%, p = 0.032) and alopecia (25% vs. 3%, p = 0.018), whereas lenvatinib-treated patients had higher rates of proteinuria (31% vs. 0%, p < 0.001) and grade 3 hypertension (31% vs. 9%, p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: TKIs demonstrated efficacy and tolerability comparable to real-world data in RR-DTC. PFS was not statistically different between sorafenib and lenvatinib.

The occurrence of KRAS mutations typically precludes the presence of RET fusions, with current medical literature suggesting a mutual exclusivity between these two genetic alterations. We present a unique case that challenges this notion. Case Presentation: An 85-year-old female with metastatic CRC was found to have a combination of genetic anomalies that is to the best of our knowledge not yet described in the medical literature: a KRAS p.G12C mutation, associated with oncogenesis and treatment resistance, and an ANK3::RET fusion, an infrequent but targetable mutation in CRC. This molecular profile was uncovered through comprehensive genomic sequencing after the patient experienced metachronous tumor dissemination. The presence of both genetic events complicates the treatment approach. Conclusions: The identification of both a KRAS p.G12C mutation and an ANK3::RET fusion in the same CRC patient adds a new layer to the oncogenic landscape and treatment considerations for CRC. It highlights the intricate decision-making required in the era of precision medicine, where targeted therapies must be carefully chosen and potentially combined to combat complex genetic profiles. The case emphasizes the urgency of investigating the clinical effects of concurrent or sequential use of KRAS p.G12C and RET inhibitors to inform future therapeutic guidelines and improve patient outcomes in similar cases.",Diagnostic Pathology,"Tillmann Bedau, Carina Heydt, Udo Siebolts, Thomas Zander, Max Kraemer, Heike Loeser, Reinhard Buettner, Alexander Quaas",,English,"Medicine; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)*/genetics; Carcinogenesis; Humans; Female; Aged, 80 and over; Colonic Neoplasms*; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Mutation; Ankyrins",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10976695,,"ANK3::RET fusion., KRAS p.G12C mutation, Genetic profiling, KRAS inhibitors, Metastatic colorectal cancer, Molecular diagnostics, Novel therapeutic strategies, Precision oncology, RET kinase inhibitors, Targeted therapy","Bedau T, Heydt C, Siebolts U, Zander T, Kraemer M, Loeser H, Buettner R, Quaas A.

During the disease course, 25-50% of patients will develop BrMs. Despite available treatments, survival rates for patients with NSCLC and BrMs remain low, and their overall prognosis is poor. Even with newer agents for NSCLC, options for treating BrMs can be limited by their ineffective transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the unique brain tumor microenvironment. The presence of actionable genomic alterations (AGAs) is a key determinant of optimal treatment selection, which aims to maximize responses and minimize toxicities. The objective of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to understand the current landscape of the clinical management of patients with NSCLC and BrMs, particularly those with AGAs. METHOD: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)-compliant SLR was conducted to identify studies in patients with BrMs in NSCLC. Searches used the EMBASE and MEDLINE® databases, and articles published between January 1, 2017 and September 26, 2022 were reviewed. RESULTS: Overall, 179 studies were included in the SLR. This subset review focused on 80 studies that included patients with NSCLC, BrMs, and AGAs (19 randomized controlled trials [RCTs], two single-arm studies, and 59 observational studies). Sixty-four of the 80 studies reported on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, 14 on anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) alterations, and two on both alterations. Ninety-five percent of studies evaluated targeted therapy. All RCTs allowed patients with previously treated, asymptomatic, or neurologically stable BrMs; the percentage of asymptomatic BrMs varied across observational studies. CONCLUSIONS: Although targeted therapies demonstrate systemic benefits for patients with NSCLC, BrMs, and AGAs, there remains a continued need for effective therapies to treat and prevent BrMs in this population. Increased BBB permeability of emerging therapies may improve outcomes for this population.",Advances in Therapy,"Mustafa Khasraw, Priyanka Yalamanchili, Anu Santhanagopal, Chuntao Wu, Maribel Salas, Jie Meng, Maha Karnoub, Stephen Esker, Enriqueta Felip",,English,"Medicine; Genomics; Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase/genetics; Humans; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/genetics/drug therapy; Brain Neoplasms*/secondary/genetics/therapy; Mutation; Lung Neoplasms*/genetics/pathology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11052832,,"EGFR mutation, Brain metastases, NSCLC, Systematic literature review","Khasraw M, Yalamanchili P, Santhanagopal A, Wu C, Salas M, Meng J, Karnoub M, Esker S, Felip E.

Therefore, its pharmacokinetics (PKs) may be affected by co‐administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, P‐gp inhibitors, and combined CYP3A4 and P‐gp inhibitors. With the frequent overlap between CYP3A4 and P‐gp substrates/inhibitors, pralsetinib is a challenging and representative example of the need to more quantitatively characterize transporter‐enzyme interplay. A physiologically‐based PK (PBPK) model for pralsetinib was developed to understand the victim drug–drug interaction (DDI) risk for pralsetinib. The key parameters driving the magnitude of pralsetinib DDIs, the P‐gp intrinsic clearance and the fraction metabolized by CYP3A4, were determined from PBPK simulations that best captured observed DDIs from three clinical studies. Sensitivity analyses and scenario simulations were also conducted to ensure these key parameters were determined with sound mechanistic rationale based on current knowledge, including the worst‐case scenarios. The verified pralsetinib PBPK model was then applied to predict the effect of other inhibitors and inducers on the PKs of pralsetinib. This work highlights the challenges in understanding DDIs when enzyme‐transporter interplay occurs, and demonstrates an important strategy for differentiating enzyme/transporter contributions to enable PBPK predictions for untested scenarios and to inform labeling.",CPT: Pharmacometrics & Systems Pharmacology,"Christine Bowman, Michael Dolton, Fang Ma, Sravanthi Cheeti, Denison Kuruvilla, Rucha Sane, Nastya Kassir, Yuan Chen","Genentech, Inc.

Brain metastases are a poor prognostic factor, and controlling them is extremely important for prolonging prognosis and improving the quality of life. Currently, local surgery and radiotherapy are recommended for their treatment. However, recently, cancer treatments using molecular-targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been introduced, which may also be effective against brain metastases.

We report the case of a patient affected by metastatic RET-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer who experienced long-lasting disease control with pralsetinib. After 13 months from treatment start, the patient developed recurrent drug-related pneumonitis, requiring temporary interruptions and dose reductions and eventually failing to control the disease. Selpercatinib was then started as an off-label treatment, allowing both clinical and radiological intracranial disease control. Selpercatinib was well-tolerated at full dosage, and no pulmonary event occurred. In our case report, after pralsetinib dose reduction due to pulmonary toxicity, the therapeutic switch to selpercatinib allowed the patient to receive a full-dose treatment, eventually restoring disease control.

A patient with metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) harboring a RET activation loop D898_E901del mutation was treated with selpercatinib. Molecular alterations were monitored with tissue biopsies and cfDNA during the treatment. The selpercatinib-responsive MTC progressed with an acquired ETV6::NTRK3 fusion, which was controlled by selpercatinib plus the NTRK inhibitor larotrectinib. Subsequently, tumor progressed with an acquired EML4::ALK fusion. Combination of selpercatinib with the dual NTRK/ALK inhibitor entrectinib reduced the tumor burden, which was followed by appearance of NTRK3 solvent-front G623R mutation. Preclinical experiments validated selpercatinib plus larotrectinib or entrectinib inhibited RET/NTRK3 dependent cells, whereas selpercatinib plus entrectinib was necessary to inhibit cells with RET/NTRK3/ALK triple alterations or a mixture of cell population carrying these genetic alterations. Thus, RET-altered MTC adapted to selpercatinib and larotrectinib with acquisition of ETV6::NTRK3 and EML4::ALK oncogenes can be managed by combination of selpercatinib and entrectinib providing proof-of-concept of urgency of incorporating molecular profiling in real-time and personalized N-of-1 care transcending one-size-fits-all approach.",npj Precision Oncology,"Vivek Subbiah, Mohamed A.

A mutation in the rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene that codes for a transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase, leads to constitutive activation of the kinase, which is the decisive pathomechanism for the disease. The MTC occurs in a sporadic (somatic RET mutation) or hereditary form (RET germline mutation, multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2 and 3). For germline mutation carriers the timing of preventive thyroidectomy depends on the RET genotype. For advanced metastasized RET-mutant MTC, selective RET kinase inhibitors are available, which are currently considered to be game changers in the treatment. Based on the specific tumor marker calcitonin, MTC can be identified at an early stage during the differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules. The preoperative calcitonin level even enables statements on the degree of dissemination of the disease and on the probability of a cure through surgery. A new development is the consideration of desmoplasia as a histopathological biomarker for the metastatic potential of a MTC, which could possibly modify the operative approach as well as the future MTC nomenclature. Furthermore, the postoperative calcitonin level and the calcitonin doubling time are highly valid prognostic markers for tumor burden and biological aggressiveness of MTC and therefore decisive for patient follow-up. Biochemical, molecular and histological markers enable a risk-adapted surgical treatment and together with new targeted systemic treatments have contributed to a paradigm shift in the diagnostics, prognosis and treatment of MTC in recent years. Endocrine precision medicine for MTC therefore enabled a change from the previous purely symptom-oriented to a modern preventive and individualized treatment.","Innere Medizin (Heidelberg, Germany)","Tim Brandenburg, Yara Maria Machlah, Dagmar Führer","Klinik für Endokrinologie, Diabetologie und Stoffwechsel, Universitätsklinikum Essen, Essen, Deutschland.

In this respect, the treatment of advanced ATC has rapidly evolved in recent years. Recently, new personalized forms of treatment that address the somatic mutational status of the tumor have been increasingly used. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of current molecular-based and personalized treatment options for ATC. METHODS: A current literature search was performed with a focus on personalized molecular-based treatment options for ATC. RESULTS: The majority of patients suffering from ATC have an advanced tumor disease at the time of initial diagnosis. Despite multimodal treatment approaches consisting of surgery, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and chemotherapy (CTX), the prognosis of ATC is still poor. Accordingly, the focus of innovative treatment approaches is on molecular-based, individualized tumor therapy, including in particular BRAFV600E and multikinase inhibitors. The potential of the latter seems to lie particularly in combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. These treatment options can be used in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Neoadjuvant treatment of advanced ATC can achieve a potentially resectable treatment setting and improve the poor prognosis of affected patients; however, larger prospective and randomized studies on these combination therapies are currently pending. CONCLUSION: The focus of future treatment approaches for ATC will be on individualized, molecular-based tumor therapy. In particular, the neoadjuvant use of these therapies may change the paradigm of ATC surgery as locally advanced as well as metastatic carcinomas can be converted to a potentially resectable status and made amenable to surgery.","Chirurgie (Heidelberg, Germany)","Sabine Wächter, Detlef K Bartsch, Elisabeth Maurer","Klinik für Visceral‑, Thorax- und Gefäßchirurgie, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Baldingerstraße, 35043, Marburg, Deutschland. seckhard@med.uni-marburg.de.",German,"Thyroid Neoplasms*/diagnosis/genetics/therapy; Humans; Prospective Studies; Prognosis; Thyroid Carcinoma, Anaplastic*/diagnosis/genetics/therapy",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37973622,,"Chemotherapy, External beam radiation therapy, Immune checkpoint inhibitors, Multikinase inhibitors, Targeted therapy options","Wächter S, Bartsch DK, Maurer E.

Existing therapies have limited efficacy, highlighting a need for innovative approaches. Methods: We analyzed 658 articles and 87 eligible clinical trials using bibliometric tools and database searches, including annual publication and citation trends, were executed using Web of Science, CiteSpace, and VOS Viewer. Results: Post-2018, there is a surge in thyroid cancer immunotherapy research, primarily from China and the University of Pisa. Of the 87 trials, 32 were Phase I and 55 were Phase II, mostly exploring combination therapies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors. Conclusion: The study's dual approach verifies the swift advancement of thyroid cancer immunotherapy from diverse perspectives. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become the preferred regimen for advanced MTC and ATC in late therapeutic lines. However, since ICB plays a pivotal role in ATC, current clinical trial data show that ATC patients account for more and the curative effect is more accurate. Anticipated future developments are inclined toward combination regimens integrating immunotherapy with chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Emerging approaches, such as bispecific antibodies, cytokine-based therapies, and adoptive cell therapies like CAR-T and TCR-T, are exhibiting considerable potential.

This study aims to analyze clinicopathological features, gene abnormalities, and prognostic outcomes in individuals diagnosed with PLC-PHM MPC. Methods: A retrospective analysis included 89 patients diagnosed with PLC-PHM MPC at the Respiratory or Hematology Departments of Ruijin Hospital from 2003 to 2022 (a total of 842,047 people). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) assessed lung cancer specimens, while Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and NGS were used for hematologic malignancy specimens. Statistical analysis involved survival analysis and Cox regression. Results: PLC-PHM MPC incidence surged from 1.67 per year (2011–2013) to 16.3 per year (2020–2022). The primary demographic for PLC-PHM MPC consists predominantly of elderly (average age 66 years) males (59.6%), with a high prevalence of metachronous MPC (89.9%). The prevailing histological types were lung adenocarcinoma (70.8%) in lung cancer (LC) and mature B-cell lymphomas (50.6%) in hematologic malignancies (HM). Notably, in a molecular testing cohort of 38 LC patients, 84.2% of lung cancer cases exhibited driver mutations, in which EGFR mutations frequence prevalent was 74.2%. In total group of 85 cases achieved a median overall survival (mOS) of 46.2 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 37.9% and advanced LC patients with LC gene mutations achieved a mOS was 52.6 months, with a 5-year OS rate of 30.6%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) following first-line treatment of 11 advanced patients with lung cancer-associated driver gene mutations is 26.6 months. Multivariate Cox regression revealed a favorable OS associated with surgery for LC, favorable PS score, adenocarcinoma pathology of LC, and the presence of genetic abnormalities associated with HM. Conclusion: PLC-PHM MPC incidence is rising, characterized by a significant proportion of lung adenocarcinoma and a high prevalence of positive driver genes, especially in EGFR. Despite suffering from two primary tumors, the PLC-PHM MPC patients had superior data of both PFS and OS, suggesting an inherently intricate background of genetic abnormalities between the two kinds of tumors.",Cancer Cell International,"Mengchen Lyu, Lifeng Luo, Ling Zhou, Xiangran Feng, Jin Yang, Ziwei Xu, Xianwen Sun, Zhiyao Bao, Xiaofei Wang, Beili Gao, Yi Xiang",,English,Biomedical and Life Sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10893654,,"Gene abnormality, Hematologic malignancy, Multiple primary cancer, Primary lung cancer, Prognosis","Lyu M, Luo L, Zhou L, Feng X, Yang J, Xu Z, Sun X, Bao Z, Wang X, Gao B, Xiang Y.

RET is known to regulate mitochondrial processes, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We previously showed that the multi-kinase inhibitors vandetanib and cabozantinib increase the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in RET-mutated thyroid tumor cells and that this effect can be exploited to increase mitochondrial enrichment of Δψm-sensitive agents in the tumor cells. In this study, we hypothesized that the RET-selective inhibitor, selpercatinib, can increase Δψm and, subsequently, tumor cell uptake of the mitochondria-targeted ubiquinone (MitoQ) to the level to break the mitochondrial homeostasis and induce lethal responses in RET-mutated thyroid tumor cells. We show that selpercatinib significantly increased Δψm, and its combination with MitoQ synergistically suppressed RET-mutated human thyroid tumor cells, which we validated using RET-targeted genetic approaches. Selpercatinib and MitoQ, in combination, also suppressed CCDC6-RET fusion cell line xenografts in mice and prolonged animal survival more effectively than single treatments of each agent. Moreover, we treated two patients with CCDC6-RET or RETM918T thyroid cancer, who could not take selpercatinib at regular doses due to adverse effects, with a dose-reduced selpercatinib and MitoQ combination. In response to this combination therapy, both patients showed tumor reduction. The quality of life of one patient significantly improved over a year until the tumor relapsed. This combination of selpercatinib with MitoQ may have therapeutic potential for patients with RET-mutated tumors and intolerant to regular selpercatinib doses.",npj Precision Oncology,"Wenjing Chen, Sophie Dream, Pui-Yin Leung, Pui-Kei Wu, Stuart Wong, Jong-In Park",,English,Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10879150,,,"Chen W, Dream S, Leung PY, Wu PK, Wong S, Park JI.

Pralsetinib received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with metastatic RET fusion‐positive non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and received accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with RET fusion‐positive thyroid cancer. Exposure–response (ER) analyses of efficacy were performed separately in patients with thyroid cancer and in patients with NSCLC, but data for all patients were pooled for the safety analysis. ER models were developed with time‐varying exposure; the effect of covariates was also examined. For patients with NSCLC, a higher starting dose was associated with improved progression‐free survival (PFS), but this improvement did not correlate with a higher exposure overall. Significant covariates included sex and baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score. For patients with thyroid cancer, a higher exposure was associated with improved PFS. Significant covariates included prior systemic cancer therapy and ECOG score. For safety, higher exposure was associated with a greater risk of grade ≥3 anemia, pneumonia, and lymphopenia. Patients with an ECOG score of ≥1 had an increased risk of grade ≥3 pneumonia. Non‐White patients had a lower risk of grade ≥3 lymphopenia. ER analysis revealed that higher pralsetinib exposure was associated with improved PFS in thyroid cancer, but not in NSCLC. However, a higher starting dose (ie, 400 vs ≤300 mg daily) was correlated with better PFS for all indications. Higher exposure was also associated with an increased risk of grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs); however, the overall incidence of these events was acceptably low (≤20%). This analysis supports the use of a 400 mg starting dose of pralsetinib, allowing for dose reduction in the event of AEs.",The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology,"Nastya Kassir, David McDougall, Denison Kuruvilla, Sean Kim, Shaun Kumar, Ahmadur Rahman, Thorsten Ruf, Sravanthi Cheeti, Wendy Ankrom","Genentech, Inc.

Methods: We screened patients with RET fusions at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University and included those who were treated with ICIs based regimens for further analysis. We evaluated clinical indicators including objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 232 patients with RET fusions were included in the study. Of these, 129 patients had their programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) expression levels tested, with 22 patients (17.8%) having a PDL1 level greater than or equal to 50%. Additionally, tumor mutational burden (TMB) status was evaluated in 35 patients, with the majority (30/35, 85.8%) having a TMB of less than 10 mutations per megabase. Out of the 38 patients treated with ICI based regimens, the median PFS was 5 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4–7.6 months) and the median OS was 19 months (95% CI: 9.7–28.3 months) at the time of data analysis. Stratification based on treatment lines did not show any significant differences in OS (18 vs. 19 months, p = 0.63) and PFS (6 vs. 5 months, p = 0.86).

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of pralsetinib in Chinese patients with advanced RET-mutant MTC. In the extension cohort of ARROW, adult patients with advanced MTC, who had not received systemic therapy (except for cytotoxic chemotherapy), were treated with pralsetinib (400 mg once daily, orally). The primary endpoints were blinded independent central-reviewed (BICR) objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Between October 9, 2019, and April 29, 2020, 34 patients were enrolled at 12 centers across China. Among them, 28 patients tested positive for RET mutations in the central laboratory, and 26 of these, with measurable disease at baseline per BICR, were included in the analysis set for tumor response. As of April 12, 2021 (data cutoff), the ORR was 73.1% (95% CI: 52.2–88.4), and the median duration of response was not reached. The most common (≥15%) grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in the 28 patients with RET-mutant MTC were neutrophil count decreased (8/28, 28.6%), blood creatine phosphokinase increased (6/28, 21.4%), and lymphocyte count decreased (5/28, 17.9%). Serious TRAEs were reported by six patients (21.4%), with the most common event being pneumonia (3/28, 10.7%). No patient discontinued treatment or died from pralsetinib-related adverse events.

Primary data from the open-label, phase 1/2 ARROW study demonstrated clinical activity and manageable safety with pralsetinib, a selective RET inhibitor, in patients with advanced/metastatic RET-altered thyroid cancer. We present an updated analysis with more patients and longer follow-up. Methods: Adult patients with advanced/metastatic RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who initiated oral pralsetinib at 400 mg once daily were included. Primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (per RECIST v1.1) and safety. Secondary endpoints included duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival. Responses were assessed in three cohorts of patients with baseline measurable disease: patients with RET-mutant MTC who had received prior cabozantinib and/or vandetanib (C/V), treatment-naïve patients with RET-mutant MTC, and patients with previously treated RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were an exploratory endpoint. Results: As of October 18, 2021, the measurable disease population comprised of 61 patients with RET-mutant MTC and prior C/V, 62 treatment-naïve patients with RET-mutant MTC, and 22 patients with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who had received prior systemic therapy, including radioactive iodine. The ORR was 55.7% [confidence interval; 95% CI: 42.4-68.5] in patients with RET-mutant MTC and prior C/V, 77.4% [95% CI: 65.0-87.1] in treatment-naïve patients with RET-mutant MTC, and 90.9% [95% CI: 70.8-98.9] in patients with previously treated RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer. Median DoR and median PFS were both 25.8 months in patients with RET-mutant MTC and prior C/V, not reached in treatment-naïve patients with RET-mutant MTC, and 23.6 and 25.4 months, respectively, in patients with previously treated RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer. In the RET-altered thyroid cancer safety population (N = 175), 97.1% of patients reported a treatment-related adverse event (TRAE); these led to discontinuation in 5.7% and dose reduction in 52.6% of patients. There was one death (0.6%) due to a TRAE. PROs improved or remained stable after pralsetinib treatment. Conclusions: In this updated analysis of the ARROW study, pralsetinib continued to show deep and durable clinical activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced/metastatic RET-altered thyroid cancer.

RECENT FINDINGS: During the last decades, diagnostic and treatment modalities for oligometastatic NSCLC have advanced significantly, leading to improved survival. Additionally, our understanding of the tumor biology of oligoprogressive disease has expanded. However, despite the efforts of organizations, such as EORTC, ESTRO, and ASTRO proposing definitions for oligometastatic and oligoprogressive disease, heterogeneity in definitions persists in (ongoing) trials. Recognizing the significance of subclassification within oligoprogressive disease in NSCLC and the varying risks associated with subsequent metastatic spread, there is a call for tailored management strategies. A consensus on standardized criteria for the definition of oligoprogressive disease is urgently needed and will not only facilitate meaningful comparisons between studies but also pave the way for the development of personalized treatment plans that take into account the heterogeneous nature of oligoprogressive disease.",Current Oncology Reports,"Mandy Jongbloed, Atulya A.

METHODS: A systematic literature review was completed using Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases. The literature search was done from June 2015 to January 2023 of the management of antiemetic prophylaxis for anticancer therapy of moderate emetic potential. RESULTS: Of 342 papers identified, 19 were relevant to update recommendations about managing antiemetic prophylaxis for systemic cancer treatment regimens of moderate emetic potential. Important practice changing updates include the use of emetic prophylaxis based on a triple combination of neurokinin (NK)1 receptor antagonist, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, and steroids for patients undergoing carboplatin (AUC ≥ 5) and women < 50 years of age receiving oxaliplatin-based treatment. A double combination of 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and steroids remains the recommended prophylaxis for other MEC. Based on the data in the literature, it is recommended that the administration of steroids should be limited to day 1 in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens, due to the demonstration of non-inferiority between the different regimens. More data is needed on the emetogenicity of new agents at moderate emetogenic risk. Of particular interest would be antiemetic studies with the agents sacituzumab-govitecan and trastuzumab-deruxtecan. Experience to date with these agents indicate an emetogenic potential comparable to carboplatin > AUC 5. Future studies should systematically include patient-related risk assessment in order to define the risk of emesis with MEC beyond the emetogenicity of the chemotherapy and improve the guidelines for new drugs. CONCLUSION: This antiemetic MASCC-ESMO guideline update includes new recommendations considering individual risk factors and the optimization of supportive anti-emetic treatments.",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,"Florian Scotté, Lee Schwartzberg, Hirotoshi Iihara, Matti Aapro, Richard Gralla, Paul J.

The main objective of the current study was to assess real-world clinical effectiveness in RAI-R DTC patients treated with first line lenvatinib monotherapy in the US. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted in RAI-R DTC patients who initiated lenvatinib monotherapy as first line treatment between February 2015 and September 2020. Anonymized data were abstracted by prescribing physicians from individual patient’s electronic health records. Clinical outcomes included provider-reported real-world best overall response (rwBOR), real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS), and overall survival (OS). Time-to-event endpoints were assessed using Kaplan–Meier methods. Results: Our study included 308 RAI-R DTC patients treated with first line lenvatinib. At lenvatinib initiation, patients’ median age was 60 years, 51.6% were female, and 26.0% of patients had an ECOG performance score of ≥2. Over the follow-up period, 32.5% of patients discontinued first line lenvatinib permanently, with others remaining on treatment. The median duration of lenvatinib therapy was 17.5 months overall. Provider-reported rwBOR (complete or partial response) to lenvatinib was 72.4%. Median rwPFS was 49.0 months. Estimated rwPFS rates at 24 and 48 months were 68.5% and 55.0%, respectively. Estimated OS rates at 24 and 72 months were 78.4% and 57.0%, respectively; median OS was not reached.

However, the shared genetic characteristics of lung function with gastrointestinal tract (GIT) diseases remain to be investigated. Methods: We first investigated the genetic correlations between three lung function traits and four GIT diseases. Second, we illustrated the genetic overlap by genome-wide pleiotropic analysis (PLACO) and further pinpointed the relevant tissue and cell types by partitioning heritability. Furthermore, we proposed pleiotropic genes as potential drug targets by drug database mining. Finally, we evaluated the causal relationships by epidemiologic observational study and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Results: We found lung function and GIT diseases were genetically correlated. We identified 258 pleiotropic loci, which were enriched in gut- and lung-specific regions marked by H3K4me1. Among these, 16 pleiotropic genes were targets of drugs, such as tofacitinib and baricitinib targeting TYK2 for the treatment of ulcer colitis and COVID-19, respectively. We identified a missense variant in TYK2, exhibiting a shared causal effect on FEV1/FVC and inflammatory bowel disease (rs12720356, PPLACO=1.38 × 10− 8).

This knowledge is gradually being translated into refined strategies to stratify, manage and treat patients with thyroid cancer.

Unravelling the genomic landscape of TC has recently led to the development of novel effective targeted treatments. To date, these treatments have mostly been evaluated in non-randomised single-arm phase II clinical trials and are consequently non-reimbursed in several countries. Furthermore, most of these agents must be tailored to individual patient molecular characteristics, a context known as personalised cancer medicine, necessitating a requirement for predictive molecular biomarker testing. Existing guidelines, both in Europe and internationally, entail mostly therapeutic rather than molecular testing recommendations. This may reflect ambiguity among experts due to lack of evidence and also practical barriers in availability of the preferred molecular somatic screening and/or targeted treatments. This article reviews existing European recommendations regarding advanced/metastatic TC management with a special focus on molecular testing, and compares findings with real-world practice based on a recent survey involving TC experts from 18 European countries. Significant disparities are highlighted between theory and practice related to variable access to infrastructure, therapies and expertise, together with the insufficient availability of multidisciplinary tumour boards. In particular, practitioners’ choice of what, how and when to test is shown to be influenced by the expertise of the available laboratory, the financing source and the existence of potential facilitators, such as clinical trial access. Overall, the need of a collaborative initiative among European stakeholders to develop standardised, accessible molecular genotyping approaches in TC is underscored.",Endocrine,"Christelle de la Fouchardière, Laura Fugazzola, Laura D.

Multi tyrosine kinase inhibitors (mTKIs) cabozantinib and vandetanib are good first line options, even vandetanib prescription is currently limited to RET mutated patients. Selective RET inhibitors such as pralsetinib could be a preferred upfront treatment in case of RET mutated MTC presenting common or gatekeeper RET mutations (e.g. M918T; V804L/M). Selpercatinib, otherwise, can be prescribed as the second line after disease progression to mTKIs. The best option for subsequent lines is to consider inclusion in clinical trials or alternatively other mTKIs such as sunitinib, sorafenib, lenvatinib, or pazopanib could be evaluated. New perspectives include next-generation RET inhibitors able to overcome resistance mechanisms responsible for disease progression to standard mTKIs and RET inhibitors, and immunotherapy for MTC presenting with high tumor mutational burden.",Current Treatment Options in Oncology,"Marta Laganà, Valentina Cremaschi, Andrea Alberti, Danica M.

However, the presence of different oncogenic driver mutations may affect the tumor microenvironment and consequently influence the clinical benefit from immunotherapy. METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive NSCLC patients (stage IIA to IIIB) who underwent radical surgery after receiving neoadjuvant immunotherapy at a single high-volume center between December 2019 and August 2022. Pathological response and long-term outcomes were compared based on the driver oncogene status, and RNA sequencing analysis was conducted to investigate the transcriptomic characteristics before and after treatment. RESULTS: Of the 167 patients included in this study, 47 had oncogenic driver mutations. KRAS driver mutations were identified in 28 patients, representing 59.6% of oncogenic driver mutations. Of these, 17 patients had a major pathological response, which was significantly higher than in the non-KRAS driver mutation group (60.7% vs. 31.6%, P = 0.049). Multivariate Cox regression analysis further revealed that the KRAS driver mutation group was an independent prognostic factor for prolonged disease-free survival (hazard ratio: 0.10, P = 0.032). The median proportion of CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in the KRAS driver mutation NSCLCs than in the non-driver mutation group (18% vs. 13%, P = 0.030). Furthermore, immune-related pathways were enriched in the KRAS driver mutation NSCLCs and activated after immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that NSCLC patients with KRAS driver mutations have a superior response to neoadjuvant immunotherapy, possibly due to their higher immunogenicity. The findings highlight the importance of considering oncogenic driver mutations in selecting neoadjuvant treatment strategies for NSCLC patients.","Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII","Ziyun Shen, Meixin Teng, Lu Han, Dongliang Bian, Jing Zhang, Xinsheng Zhu, Yang Qing, Shiqi Hu, Yan Chen, Wangchao Yao, Huansha Yu, Lele Zhang, Peng Zhang",,English,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/therapy/drug therapy; Retrospective Studies; Neoadjuvant Therapy; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism; Humans; Lung Neoplasms*/therapy/drug therapy; Tumor Microenvironment; Immunotherapy; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics; Mutation; Medicine",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10992055,,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors, KRAS driver mutations, Neoadjuvant immunotherapy, Non-small cell lung cancer, Oncogenic driver mutations","Shen Z, Teng M, Han L, Bian D, Zhang J, Zhu X, Qing Y, Hu S, Chen Y, Yao W, Yu H, Zhang L, Zhang P.

Pralsetinib has shown great efficacy in RET fusion-positive NSCLC, but a series of adverse reactions will inevitably occur in the meantime. We aimed to explore the clinical characteristics of patients with pneumonia and recognition it in early stage, so patients could longer benefit from pralsetinib. Methods: This is a multicenter, retrospective study. RET fusion-positive advanced NSCLC patients who developed pneumonia during pralsetinib treatment from January 2020 to December 2022 were included. Clinical data, time to onset of pneumonia, methods of pneumonia diagnosis, treatment with pneumonia, prognosis of pneumonia, and the effect of pneumonia on the efficacy of pralsetinib. Results: A total of 8 patients with pneumonia were included in the study, most of which were non-smoking female patients and the main fusion gene was KIF5B (87.5%), which was consistent with the general characteristics of RET fusion population. The median occurrence time of pralsetinib-associated pneumonia was 2.15 (range 1.1–6.63) months. All patients were infected by opportunistic pathogens, and the most common pathogen was human herpesviruses and pneumospora yerbii. Fever was always the first symptom, and timely anti-infective treatment including antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and antifungal drugs was effective. Until February 28, 2023, the median follow-up time was 18.7 months, the mean PFS of patients was 17.4 months, and the median PFS was not reached. Fortunately, patients who restarted pralsetinib after infection control continued to benefit. Conclusions: Opportunistic infection may be a unique adverse effect of pralsetinib.

For the purposes of this summary, only patients with NSCLC with a change in RET called fusion (RET fusion+) are highlighted. WHAT WERE THE RESULTS?: In total, 281 patients with RET fusion+ NSCLC had taken part in this study across the USA, Europe, and Asia. Patients were asked to take four pills (adding up to 400 mg) of pralsetinib each day and were checked for any changes in their tumours, as well as for any side effects. After an average of 8 months of treatment with pralsetinib, 72% of previously untreated patients and 59% of patients who had previously received chemotherapy had considerable shrinkage of their tumours. Among 10 patients with tumours which had spread to the brain (all of whom had received previous treatments), 70% had their tumours shrink greatly in the brain after treatment with pralsetinib. On average, patients lived with little to no tumour growth for 16 months. In previously untreated patients, the most common severe side effects that were considered related to pralsetinib treatment were decreased white blood cells (neutrophils and lymphocytes), increased blood pressure, and an increase in a blood protein called creatine phosphokinase. In previously treated patients, the severe side effects were decreased white blood cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, and leukocytes), increased blood pressure, and low levels of red blood cells. In both untreated and previously treated patients, the most common severe side effects that required hospital attention were lung inflammation/swelling causing shortness of breath (pneumonitis) and lung infection (pneumonia). WHAT DO THE RESULTS MEAN?: Overall, the ARROW study showed that pralsetinib was effective in shrinking tumours in patients with RET fusion+ NSCLC regardless of previous treatment history. The recorded side effects were expected in patients receiving this type of medicine.

Until the last decade, most of these cases underwent diagnostic surgery, although only a minority (13-34%) confirmed malignancy postoperatively. In view of this, with the objective of improving the preoperative diagnosis in these cases, the molecular tests emerged, which are validated from the diagnostic point of view, presenting good performance, with good diagnostic accuracy, being able to avoid diagnostic surgeries. With the advancement of knowledge of the role of each of the mutations and gene rearrangements in thyroid oncogenesis, molecular markers have left to play only a diagnostic role and have been gaining more and more space both in defining the prognostic role of the tumor, as well as in the indication of target therapy. Thus, the objective of this review is to show how to use the tool of molecular tests, now commercially available in the world, in the management of indeterminate cytological nodules, assessing the pre-test malignancy risk of the nodule, through clinical, ultrasonographic and cytological characteristics, and decide on the benefit of molecular testing for each patient.

Pralsetinib is a selective inhibitor of RET kinase and has shown efficacy in oncogenic RET-altered tumors. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of expanded access program (EAP) use of pralsetinib in pretreated, advanced NSCLC patients with RET rearrangement.Materials and Methods Patients who received pralsetinib as part of the EAP at Samsung Medical Center were evaluated through a retrospective chart review. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) ver. 1.1 guidelines. Secondary endpoints were duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety profiles.Results Between April 2020 and September 2021, 23 of 27 patients were enrolled in the EAP study. Two patients who were not analyzed due to brain metastasis and two patients whose expected survival was within 1 month were excluded from the analysis. After a median follow-up period of 15.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.0 to 21.2), ORR was 56.5%, the median PFS was 12.1 months (95% CI, 3.3 to 20.9), and the 12-month OS rate was 69.6%. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were edema (43.5%) and pneumonitis (39.1%). A total of 8.7% of patients experienced extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. TRAEs with a common grade of three or worse were neutropenia (43.5%) and anemia (34.8%).

In searching for therapeutic target kinase(s) in these breast cancers, Gou and colleagues identified FLT4, RET, JAK1, and IGF1R as the top upregulated kinases induced by ESR1-TAFs and ERα LBD mutants in breast cancer cells. Among them, inhibition of RET by pralsetinib suppressed ESR1-TAF–driven and ERα LBD mutant–driven cell proliferation and patient-derived xenograft growth. Pralsetinib is an inhibitor of the RET protein tyrosine kinase that is approved for treating oncogenic RET mutation–positive and RET fusion–positive thyroid cancers and non–small cell lung cancer. The work by Gou and colleagues reinforces the knowledge of RET as an ESR1 target gene and highlights that RET interacts with ERα to promote breast cancer tumorigenesis and antiestrogen resistance. It also raises the prospect of repositioning pralsetinib to target wildtype RET in ER-positive breast cancer.

Small-molecule RET kinase inhibitors became standard-of-care therapy for advanced malignancies driven by RET. The therapeutic benefit of RET inhibitors is limited, however, by acquired mutations in the drug target as well as brain metastasis, presumably due to inadequate brain penetration. Here, we perform preclinical characterization of vepafestinib (TAS0953/HM06), a next-generation RET inhibitor with a unique binding mode. We demonstrate that vepafestinib has best-in-class selectivity against RET, while exerting activity against commonly reported on-target resistance mutations (variants in RETL730, RETV804 and RETG810), and shows superior pharmacokinetic properties in the brain when compared to currently approved RET drugs. We further show that these properties translate into improved tumor control in an intracranial model of RET-driven cancer.

By enabling the visualization of molecular and cellular processes, these techniques contribute to a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and the development of more effective clinical interventions. Different nuclear imaging techniques have been studied for assessing MTC, and among them, PET/CT utilizing multiple radiotracers has emerged as the most effective imaging method in clinical practice. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the current use of advanced molecular imaging modalities, with a particular focus on PET/CT, for the management of patients with MTC. It aims to guide physicians towards a rationale for the use of molecular imaging also including theranostic approaches and novel therapeutical opportunities.

Treatment for tSCLC has not been established yet, and chemotherapy regimens for de novo SCLC are mostly recommended. However, these treatments showed disappointing outcome, and novel anti-cancer agents and immunological approaches are currently being developed. The patient-derived cell line is a critical tool for pre-clinical and translational research, but cell line models for tSCLC are not publicly available from cell banks. The aim of this study was to establish and characterize a novel cell line for tSCLC. Using a lymph-node biopsy tissue from a 58-year-old female patient, whose tumor was EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma progressed on afatinib, we successfully established a cell line, named BMC-PDC-019.

Despite never smokers comprising between 10 and 25% of all cases, lung cancer in never smokers (LCNS) is relatively under characterized from an etiological and biological perspective. The application of multi-omics techniques on large patient cohorts has significantly advanced the current understanding of LCNS tumor biology. By synthesizing the findings of multi-omics studies on LCNS from a clinical perspective, we can directly translate knowledge regarding tumor biology into implications for patient care. Primarily focused on never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma, this review details the predominance of driver mutations, particularly in East Asian patients, as well as the frequency and importance of germline variants in LCNS. The mutational patterns present in LCNS tumors are thoroughly explored, highlighting the high abundance of the APOBEC signature. Moreover, this review recognizes the spectrum of immune profiles present in LCNS tumors and posits how it can be translated to treatment selection. The recurring and novel insights from multi-omics studies on LCNS tumor biology have a wide range of clinical implications. Risk factors such as exposure to outdoor air pollution, second hand smoke, and potentially diet have a genomic imprint in LCNS at varying degrees, and although they do not encompass all LCNS cases, they can be leveraged to stratify risk. Germline variants similarly contribute to a notable proportion of LCNS, which warrants detailed documentation of family history of lung cancer among never smokers and demonstrates value in developing testing for pathogenic variants in never smokers for early detection in the future. Molecular driver subtypes and specific co-mutations and mutational signatures have prognostic value in LCNS and can guide treatment selection. LCNS tumors with no known driver alterations tend to be stem-like and genes contributing to this state may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Overall, the comprehensive findings of multi-omics studies exert a wide influence on clinical management and future research directions in the realm of LCNS.",Journal of Translational Medicine,"Peiyao Wang, Sophie Sun, Stephen Lam, William W.

There is often a history of previous differentiated thyroid cancer suggesting a biological progression. It is clinically characterized by a locally invasive cervical mass of rapid onset. Metastases are found at diagnosis in 50% of patients. Due to its adverse prognosis, a prompt diagnosis is crucial. In patients with unresectable or metastatic disease, multimodal therapy (chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy) has yielded poor outcomes with 12-month overall survival of less than 20%. Recently, significant progress has been made in understanding the oncogenic pathways of ATC, leading to the identification of BRAF V600E mutations as the driver oncogene in nearly 40% of cases. The combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (D) and MEK inhibitor trametinib (T) showed outstanding response rates in BRAF-mutated ATC and is now considered the standard of care in this setting. Recently, it was shown that neoadjuvant use of DT followed by surgery achieved 24-month overall survival rates of 80%. Although these approaches have changed the management of ATC, effective therapies are still needed for patients with BRAF wild-type ATC, and high-quality evidence is lacking for most aspects of this neoplasia. Additionally, in real-world settings, timely access to multidisciplinary care, molecular testing, and targeted therapies continues to be a challenge.

This mutation often predicts metastasis risk and poor prognosis, and current mainstream therapies provide limited patient benefit. Selective RET inhibitors Pralsetinib and Selpercatinib are targeted drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating RET-mutated tumors. The phase I/II clinical trial results of their treatment of NSCLC have been published. However, the clinical effect of selective RET inhibitors on RET fusion-positive NSCLC remains controversial. Purpose Meta-analysis was performed to investigate the efficacy and safety of selective RET inhibitors in treating RET fusion-positive NSCLC. Methods Qualified literature was searched in Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science. Outcomes included objective response rate (ORR), median progression-free survival (mPFS), disease control rate (DCR), intracranial ORR, and adverse events. Stata 15.1 software was used to analyze the data. Results A total of 8 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The combined results showed that the ORR of patients treated with selective RET inhibitors was 67% (95% confidence interval:0.64 to 0.70, P < 0.01), DCR was 92% (95%CI: 0.91–0.94, P < 0.01), the mPFS was 16.09 months (95%CI: 11.66–20.52, P < 0.01). In treated patients with RET mutation, the intracranial ORR was 86% (95%CI:0.74 ~ 0.96, P < 0.01). ORR in untreated patients was more effective than untreated patients [HR = 0.44 (95%CI: 0.35–0.56, P < 0.01)]. The major adverse events (grade 3–4) are neutropenia (13%) and anaemia (13%).

Early-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) often provide robust systemic disease control in patients with oncogene-driven NSCLCs, although these agents are usually unable to accumulate to therapeutically relevant concentrations in the CNS owing to an inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. However, the past few years have seen a paradigm shift with the emergence of several novel or later-generation TKIs with improved CNS penetrance. Such agents have promising levels of activity against brain metastases, as demonstrated by data from preclinical and clinical studies. In this Review, we describe current preclinical and clinical evidence of the intracranial activity of TKIs targeting various oncogenic drivers in patients with NSCLC, with a focus on newer agents with enhanced CNS penetration, leptomeningeal disease and the need for intrathecal treatment options.

In the last decade, significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, particularly NSCLC, have been achieved with the help of molecular translational research. Among the hopeful breakthroughs in therapeutic approaches, advances in targeted therapy have brought the most successful outcomes in NSCLC treatment. In targeted therapy, antagonists target the specific genes, proteins, or the microenvironment of tumors supporting cancer growth and survival. Indeed, cancer can be managed by blocking the target genes related to tumor cell progression without causing noticeable damage to normal cells. Currently, efforts have been focused on improving the targeted therapy aspects regarding the encouraging outcomes in cancer treatment and the quality of life of patients. Treatment with targeted therapy for NSCLC is changing rapidly due to the pace of scientific research. Accordingly, this updated study aimed to discuss the tumor target antigens comprehensively and targeted therapy-related agents in NSCLC.

However, some locally advanced patients are not candidates for R0/1 resection. There is limited evidence of neoadjuvant treatment in locally advanced DTC. Surufatinib targets multiple kinases, which is efficient, tolerable, and safe in patients with radioiodine-refractory DTC. In addition, surufatinib plus toripalimab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) showed encouraging antitumor activity in advanced solid tumors. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surufatinib plus toripalimab in locally advanced DTC in the neoadjuvant setting. METHODS: In this single-arm, phase II study, patients with pathologically confirmed unresectable or borderline resectable DTC were eligible and received a combination of 250 mg of surufatinib (orally daily) with 240 mg of toripalimab (intravenous, every 3 weeks). Treatment continued until satisfied for curative surgery, disease progression, withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, or investigator decision. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included R0/1 resection rate, adverse events (AEs), etc. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled and received at least 4 cycles of treatment. The ORR was 60%. Nine patients received R0/1 resections after neoadjuvant treatment. The median best percentage change in the sum of the target lesion diameter was 32%. Most adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS: Surufatinib in combination with toripalimab as neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced DTC was feasible, and the majority of patients achieved R0/1 resection. It represents a new option for locally advanced DTC and needs further investigation.",Annals of Surgical Oncology,"Jia-ying Chen, Nai-si Huang, Wen-jun Wei, Jia-qian Hu, Yi-ming Cao, Qiang Shen, Zhong-wu Lu, Yu-long Wang, Yu Wang, Qing-hai Ji",,English,Medicine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37543550,,,"Chen JY, Huang NS, Wei WJ, Hu JQ, Cao YM, Shen Q, Lu ZW, Wang YL, Wang Y, Ji QH.

Multi-targeted kinase inhibitors (MKI) and tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) with high specificity for RET protein are approved for advanced MTC treatment. However, their efficacy is hindered by evasion mechanisms of tumor cells. Thus, the aim of this study was the identification of an escape mechanism in MTC cells exposed to a highly selective RET TKI. TT cells were treated with TKI, MKI, and/or the HH-Gli inhibitors, GANT61 and Arsenic Trioxide (ATO), in the presence or absence of hypoxia. RET modifications, oncogenic signaling activation, proliferation and apoptosis were assessed. Additionally, cell modifications and HH-Gli activation were also evaluated in pralsetinib-resistant TT cells. Pralsetinib inhibited RET autophosphorylation and RET downstream pathways activation in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Additionally, pralsetinib impaired proliferation, induced the activation of apoptosis and, in hypoxic cells, downregulated HIF-1α. Focusing on escape molecular mechanisms associated with therapy, we observed increased Gli1 levels in a subset of cells. Indeed, pralsetinib stimulated the re-localization of Gli1 into the cell nuclei. Treatment of TT cells with both pralsetinib and ATO resulted in Gli1 down-regulation and impaired cell viability. Moreover, pralsetinib-resistant cells confirmed Gli1 activation and up-regulation of its transcriptionally regulated target genes. Altogether, we showed that pralsetinib impairs MTC cell growth and induces cell death, also in hypoxic conditions. The HH-Gli pathway is a new molecular mechanism of escape to pralsetinib therapy that can be overcome through combined therapy.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,"Sofia Trocchianesi, Agnese Po, Anna Citarella, Zaira Spinello, Aurelia Rughetti, Zein Mersini Besharat, Tanja Milena Autilio, Valeria Pecce, Antonella Verrienti, Rossella Elisei, Cosimo Durante, Giuseppina Catanzaro, Elisabetta Ferretti",,English,"Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine; Humans; Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors*; Zinc Finger Protein GLI1/metabolism; Thyroid Neoplasms*/genetics; Arsenic Trioxide; Signal Transduction",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37301138,,"HH-Gli signaling, Hypoxia, Medullary thyroid carcinoma, Normoxia, Pralsetinib, Resistance to therapy","Trocchianesi S, Po A, Citarella A, Spinello Z, Rughetti A, Besharat ZM, Autilio TM, Pecce V, Verrienti A, Elisei R, Durante C, Catanzaro G, Ferretti E.

Many sexual partners and early age at first intercourse have been demonstrated to have a significant influence on risk. TGF-β1 is a multifunctional cytokine that is required for cervical carcinoma metastasis, tumor development, progression, and invasion. The TGF-β1 signaling system plays a paradoxical function in cancer formation, suppressing early-stage tumor growth while increasing tumor progression and metastasis. Importantly, TGF-β1 and TGF-β receptor 1 (TGF-βR1), two components of the TGF-β signaling system, are substantially expressed in a range of cancers, including breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The current study aims to investigate possible inhibitors targeting TGF-β1 using molecular docking and dynamic simulations. To target TGF-β1, we used anti-cancer drugs and small molecules. MVD was utilized for virtual screening, and the highest scoring compound was then subjected to MD simulations using Schrodinger software package v2017-1 (Maestro v11.1) to identify the most favorable lead interactions against TGF-β1. The Nilotinib compound has shown the least XP Gscore of -2.581 kcal/mol, 30ns MD simulations revealing that the Nilotinib- TGF-β1 complex possesses the lowest energy of -77784.917 kcal/mol. Multiple parameters, including Root Mean Square Deviation, Root Mean Square Fluctuation, and Intermolecular Interactions, were used to analyze the simulation trajectory.

The definition of RAI-refractoriness is usually a clear situation in specialized centers. However, the right moment for initiation of multikinase inhibitors (MKI), the time and availability for genomic testing, and the possibility of prescribing MKI and selective kinase inhibitors differ worldwide.Latin America (LA) refers to the territories of the world that stretch across two regions: North America (including Central America and the Caribbean) and South America, containing 8.5% of the world's population. In this manuscript, we critically review the current standard approach recommended for patients with RAI refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, emphasizing the challenges faced in LA. To achieve this objective, the Latin American Thyroid Society (LATS) convened a panel of experts from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. Access to MKI compounds continues to be a challenge in all LA countries. This is true not only for MKI but also for the new selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which will also require genomic testing, that is not widely available. Thus, as precision medicine advances, significant disparities will be made more evident, and despite efforts to improve coverage and reimbursement, molecular-based precision medicine remains inaccessible to most of the LA population.

However, they have seldom been reported in tumours other than lung or thyroid cancers. The correlation of RET aberrations with clinical characteristics, co-occurring aberrations, and responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi) have not been explored in digestive tract tumours. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to elucidate the clinical characteristics, frequently co-altered genes, and treatment responses in RET-aberrant digestive tract tumours. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients with digestive tract cancers for RET-aberrant tumours via FoundationOne CDx tumour-based selected genome sequencing from Jan 2016 to Jan 2021. RESULTS: In a median follow-up time of 51 months, a total of 453 patients were analysed. RET-aberrant tumours accounted for 4.4% in the studied population (n = 20), and 1.1% had an oncogenic fusion (n = 5). APC, KRAS, TP53, MSH6 and STK11 were the differentially co-altered genes (all false discovery rates <0.05). The presence of RET aberrations alone was not a significant prognostic factor. Eleven patients with RET-aberrant tumours received ICPi-based treatment and none achieved an objective response. In contrast, 47 patients with non-aberrant tumours received ICPi treatment and had an objective response rate of 27.7% and a significantly longer treatment duration (6.2 vs 2.8 months, p = 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: Albeit rarely, RET aberrations can be found in digestive tract tumours. Patients with RET-aberrant tumours have a blunted response to ICPi and a comparable prognosis as compared with RET-wild type tumours. Together, these results provide insights into this rare but potentially actionable target in digestive tract tumours.",Targeted Oncology,"Chih-Chieh Yen, Yu-Min Yeh, Hsuan-Yi Huang, Yu-Lin Ting, Pei-An Fu, Tzu-Chien Lin, I-Ting Liu, Chia-Jui Yen",,English,Lung Neoplasms*/drug therapy; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics/therapeutic use; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms*/drug therapy; Medicine; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10345067,,,"Yen CC, Yeh YM, Huang HY, Ting YL, Fu PA, Lin TC, Liu IT, Yen CJ.

As part of the global, phase 1/2 ARROW trial (NCT03037385), the efficacy and safety of pralsetinib in Chinese patients with advanced RET fusion‐positive non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were evaluated.Methods: Adult patients with advanced, RET fusion–positive NSCLC with or without prior platinum‐based chemotherapy were enrolled into two cohorts receiving 400‐mg once‐daily oral pralsetinib. Primary end points were objective response rates assessed by blinded independent central review and safety.Results: Of 68 patients enrolled, 37 had received prior platinum‐based chemotherapy (48.6% with ≥3 prior systemic regimens) and 31 were treatment‐naïve. As of March 4, 2022 (data cutoff), of the patients with measurable lesions at baseline, a confirmed objective response was observed in 22 (66.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 48.2–82.0) of 33 pretreated patients, including 1 (3.0%) complete response and 21 (63.6%) partial responses; and in 25 (83.3%; 95% CI, 65.3–94.4) of 30 treatment‐naïve patients, including two (6.7%) complete responses and 23 (76.7%) partial responses. Median progression‐free survival was 11.7 months (95% CI, 8.7–not estimable) in pretreated patients and 12.7 months (95% CI, 8.9–not estimable) in treatment‐naïve patients. The most common grade 3/4 treatment‐related adverse events in 68 patients were anemia (35.3%) and decreased neutrophil count (33.8%).

Little is known about the characteristics and management of BM from TC. Thus, we retrospectively analyzed patients with histologically verified TC and radiologically verified BM identified from the Vienna Brain Metastasis Registry. A total of 20/6074 patients included in the database since 1986 had BM from TC and 13/20 were female. Ten patients had FTC, 8 PTC, one MTC and one ATC. The median age at diagnosis of BM was 68 years. All but one had symptomatic BM and 13/20 patients had a singular BM. Synchronous BM at primary diagnosis were found in 6 patients, while the median time to BM diagnosis was 13 years for PTC (range 1.9–24), 4 years for FTC (range 2.1–41) and 22 years for the MTC patient. The overall survival from diagnosis of BM was 13 months for PTC (range 1.8–57), 26 months for FTC (range 3.9–188), 12 years for the MTC and 3 months for the ATC patient. In conclusion, development of BM from TC is exceedingly rare and the most common presentation is a symptomatic single lesion.

The cellular immune landscape of CCA has been characterized and tumour subsets with distinct immune microenvironments have been defined using molecular approaches. Among these subsets, the identification of 'immune-desert' tumours that are relatively devoid of immune cells emphasizes the need to consider the tumour immune microenvironment in the development of immunotherapy approaches. Progress has also made in identifying the complex heterogeneity and diverse functions of cancer-associated fibroblasts in this desmoplastic cancer. Assays measuring circulating cell-free DNA and cell-free tumour DNA are emerging as clinical tools for detection and monitoring of the disease. Molecularly targeted therapy for CCA has now become a reality, with three drugs targeting oncogenic fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions and one targeting neomorphic, gain-of-function variants of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) obtaining regulatory approval. By contrast, immunotherapy using immune-checkpoint inhibitors has produced disappointing results in patients with CCA, underscoring the requirement for novel immune-based treatment strategies. Finally, liver transplantation for early stage intrahepatic CCA under research protocols is emerging as a viable therapeutic option in selected patients.

For example, although thyroid nodules in children are much less common than in adults, a higher percentage is malignant. Moreover, while pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is associated with more advanced disease, death due to disease in children and adolescents is very rare, even when distant metastases are present. Some subtypes of thyroid carcinoma, like diffuse sclerosing variant, are especially common in children and adolescents. Moreover, certain histologic findings, such as a tall cell morphology or increased mitotic activity, may not carry the same prognostic significance in children as in adults. Recent studies exploring the molecular underpinnings of pediatric thyroid carcinoma indicate that while driver alterations of thyroid tumorigenesis in children and adults are essentially the same, they occur at very different frequencies, with translocation-associated tumors (most commonly harboring RET and NTRK fusions) comprising a sizable and distinct group of pediatric PTC. DICER1 mutations, an infrequent mutation in adult thyroid tumors, are relatively frequent in pediatric encapsulated follicular-patterned thyroid tumors (with or without invasion or nuclear features of PTC). Additionally, tumor predisposition syndromes (most notably DICER1 syndrome and PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes such as Cowden syndrome) should be considered in children with thyroid tumors, especially follicular-patterned thyroid tumors and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

Secreted phosphoprotein-1, also known as OPN (osteopontin), is an integrin-binding glycophosphoprotein that is overexpressed in a variety of tumors. OPN is a chemokine-like calcified ECM-associated protein that plays a crucial role in evaluating the metastatic potential of various cancers. However, the role of SPP1 in the tumor microenvironment and associated signaling pathways in CC is still unclear. In our study, three CC microarray datasets (GSE9750, GSE46857, and GSE67522) were obtained from the GEO database to identify the differentially expressed genes. Enrichment analysis was carried out by Enrichr and ShinyGO and the PPI interaction network was created by using String and Cytoscape. GEPIA datasets were used to validate the top 10 hub genes, and virtual screening, docking, and dynamic simulation studies were used to identify a suitable inhibitor against the OPN protein using MVD, PyRx, and GROMACS respectively. Our results show that a total of 11 DEGs were common for three datasets and gene ontology pathway enrichment analysis revealed that 2 biological processes i.e. programmed cell death and animal organ development commonly affected mechanisms in all three datasets. Docking and dynamic studies revealed that Entrectinib showed excellent binding affinity against OPN protein. Based on the results, we conclude that OPN is one of the most upregulated genes in cervical cancer and Entrectinib emerges to be a promising potential OPN inhibitor to curtail cervical cancer progression.

Rearranged during transfection (RET) fusions are common genetic drivers of PTC and the potent RET inhibitor selpercatinib has been recently approved for treating advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer. In this study we aimed to develop a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) system to accurately detect RET fusion in PTC samples. Methods: The frequency and distribution of RET fusions in PTC were analyzed using genomic data of 402 PTC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. To establish the ddPCR system for detecting CCDC6::RET fusion, a plasmid containing CCDC6::RET infusion fragment was constructed as standard template, the annealing temperature and concentrations of primers and probe were optimized. The analytical performance of ddPCR and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) were assessed in standard templates and tissue samples from 112 PTC patients. Sanger sequencing was performed in all the RET fusion-positive samples identified by ddPCR. Results: RET fusions were observed in 25 (6.2%) of the 402 TCGA samples, and 15 (60%) of the RET fusion-positive patients had the CCDC6::RET fusion. Compared with qRT-PCR, the ddPCR method showed a lower limit of detection (128.0 and 430.7 copies/reaction for ddPCR and qRT-PCR, respectively). When applying the two methods to 112 tissue samples of PTC, eleven (9.8%) CCDC6::RET fusion-positive samples were detected by qRT-PCR, while ddPCR identified 4 additional positive samples (15/112, 13.4%). All the CCDC6::RET fusion-positive cases identified by ddPCR were confirmed by Sanger sequencing except for one case with 0.14 copies/uL of the fusion. Conclusion: The accurate and sensitive ddPCR method reported here is powerful to detection CCDC6::RET fusion in PTC samples, application of this method would benefit more RET fusion-positive patients in the clinic.",BMC Cancer,"Mengke Chen, Junyu Xue, Ye Sang, Wenting Jiang, Weiman He, Shubin Hong, Weiming Lv, Haipeng Xiao, Rengyun Liu",,English,"Biomedical and Life Sciences; Thyroid Neoplasms*/genetics/pathology; Humans; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics; Thyroid Cancer, Papillary/pathology; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics; Polymerase Chain Reaction",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10120194,,"Molecular diagnosis, RET fusion, Thyroid cancer, ddPCR","Chen M, Xue J, Sang Y, Jiang W, He W, Hong S, Lv W, Xiao H, Liu R.

We analyzed the effect of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy on survival time and side effects in patients with ATC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed all patients (n = 63) with histologically confirmed ATC who presented at our clinic between 1989 and 2020. We analyzed the survival with Kaplan–Meier curves and cox proportional hazard models and acute toxicities with logistic regression models. Results: Out of 63 patients, 62 received radiotherapy, 74% underwent surgery and 24% received combined chemotherapy. A median radiation dose of 49 Gy (range 4–66 Gy) was applied. In 32% of the cases opposing-field technique was used, in 18% 3D-conformal, in 27% a combination of opposing field and 3D-conformal technique and 21% obtained IMRT (intensity modulated radiotherapy) or VMAT (volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy). Median overall survival (OS) was 6 months. We identified five predictive factors relevant for survival: absence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis (OS 8 months), surgery (OS 9.8 months), resection status R0 (OS 14 months), radiation dose of 50 Gy or higher (OS 13 months) and multimodal therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) with a median OS of 9.7 months. Conclusion: In spite of the dismal outcome, longer survival can be achieved in some patients with ATC using surgery and radiotherapy with a high radiation dose. Compared to our previous study, there are no significant advantages in overall survival.

Their low incidence and drastic regional disparities result in the difficulty of informative evidence-based diagnosis and subtyping. Sample exhaustion due to difficulty in diagnosis also leads to a lack of recommended therapeutic strategies in clinical guidelines, insufficient biomarkers for prognosis/efficacy, and inability to identify potential novel therapies in clinical trials.

Oncogenic RET fusions or mutations are found most often in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in thyroid cancer, but also increasingly in various types of cancers at low rates. In the last few years, two potent and selective RET protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), pralsetinib (BLU-667) and selpercatinib (LOXO-292, LY3527723) were developed and received regulatory approval. Although pralsetinib and selpercatinib gave high overall response rates (ORRs), < 10% of patients achieved a complete response (CR). The RET TKI-tolerated residual tumors inevitably develop resistance by secondary target mutations, acquired alternative oncogenes, or MET amplification. RET G810 mutations located at the kinase solvent front site were identified as the major on-target mechanism of acquired resistance to both selpercatinib and pralsetinib. Several next-generation of RET TKIs capable of inhibiting the selpercatinib/pralsetinib-resistant RET mutants have progressed to clinical trials. However, it is likely that new TKI-adapted RET mutations will emerge to cause resistance to these next-generation of RET TKIs.

However, the relationship between necroptosis and bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC) has yet to be fully understood. To shed light on this issue, our study aimed to uncover the impact of necroptosis on immune cell infiltration and immunotherapy response in BUC patients. We conducted an analysis of 67 necroptosis genes to assess their expression and genomic changes across pan-cancer and identified 12 necroptosis genes that are prognostically relevant and associated with immune subtypes and tumor stemness in BUC. Using a public database of 1841 BUC samples, we then performed Unsupervised Cluster Analysis and discovered two distinct necroptotic phenotypes in BUC. These phenotypes showed significant differences in molecular subtypes, immune infiltration patterns, and gene mutation profiles. We confirmed this discovery in BUC through qPCR and WB experiments. To evaluate the impact of necroptosis on prognosis, chemotherapy sensitivity, and immunotherapy response (such as anti-PD-L1), we developed a principal component analysis model called NecroScore. Finally, we validated the effects of RIPK3 and MLKL through a nude mouse transplantation model for BUC. Our study has uncovered that necroptosis plays a role in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment in BUC. The high necroptosis phenotype (Cluster B) was characterized by a higher abundance of tumor immunosuppressive cells and more key biological processes driving tumor progression, while the low necroptosis group (Cluster A) had higher FGFR3 mutations. We found that the infiltration levels of immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, were significantly different between FGFR3 mutated and wild-type (WT) samples. Our results confirmed the reliability of NecroScore as a comprehensive assessment tool for evaluating the immunotherapeutic effect and prognosis of BUC patients, with high NecroScore values favoring basal-like differentiation and lower FGFR3 alterations. We also observed that high expression of MLKL had a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth and increased neutrophil infiltration in vivo. In our study, we uncovered the regulation pattern of necroptosis in the tumor immune microenvironment of BUC. Additionally, we developed a scoring tool called NecroScore that can be utilized to predict the most suitable chemotherapy and immunotherapy strategy for bladder urothelial carcinoma patients. This tool can effectively guide the chemotherapy and immunotherapy regimens for patients with advanced BUC.",Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,"Boqiang Zhong, Youzhi Wang, Yihao Liao, Jiaming Liang, Keke Wang, Diansheng Zhou, Yang Zhao, Ning Jiang",,English,"Mice; Apoptosis; Protein Kinases; Biomedical and Life Sciences; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell*; Urinary Bladder; Necroptosis/genetics; Immunotherapy; Animals; Reproducibility of Results; Tumor Microenvironment/genetics; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms*/drug therapy/genetics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10232593,,"BUC, Chemotherapy, Diagnosis, ICIs, Immunotherapy, Necroptosis, Pan-cancer, Prognosis, Tumor immune microenvironment","Zhong B, Wang Y, Liao Y, Liang J, Wang K, Zhou D, Zhao Y, Jiang N.

Methods: Between 2019 and 2022, we analyzed the genetic profile of 99 patients with glioma through the Oncomine Focus Assay. The assay enables the detection of mutations in 52 driver genes, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs), and gene fusions. We also collected and analyzed patients’ clinic characteristics and treatment outcomes. Results: Over a period of 35 months, 700 patients with glioma followed by our neuro-oncology unit were screened, and 99 were enrolled in the study; most of the patients were excluded for inadequate non-morphological MRI or lack/inadequacy of the tissue samples. Based on our findings, most patients with glioma present mutations, such as SNVs, CNVs or gene fusions. Our data were similar to those reported by The Cancer Genome Atlas Program in terms of frequency of SNVs and CNVs, while we observed more cases of gene fusions. Median overall survival, progression-free survival, and time to progression were significantly lower for patients with grade VI glioblastoma than those with other gliomas. Only four patients were offered a targeted treatment based on the mutation detected; however, only one received treatment, the others could not receive the selected treatment because of worsening clinical status.

In adults, RET alterations have been characterized as drivers of non-small cell lung cancer and multiple neuroendocrine neoplasms. In breast cancer, RET signaling networks have been shown to influence diverse functions including tumor development, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. While RET is known to drive the development and progression of multiple solid tumors, therapeutic agents selectively targeting RET are relatively new, though multiple multi-kinase inhibitors have shown promise as RET inhibitors in the past; further, RET has been historically neglected as a potential therapeutic co-target in endocrine-refractory breast cancers despite mounting evidence for a key pathologic role and repeated description of a bi-directional relationship with the estrogen receptor, the principal driver of most breast tumors. Additionally, the recent discovery of RET enrichment in breast cancer brain metastases suggests a role for RET inhibition specific to advanced disease.

With the exception of rare examples, most are well-differentiated epithelial neuroendocrine neoplasms (also known as neuroendocrine tumors in the taxonomy of the International Agency for Research on Cancer [IARC] of the World Health Organization [WHO]). This review provides an overview and recent evidence-based data on the molecular genetics, disease risk stratification based on clinicopathologic variables including molecular profiling and histopathologic variables, and targeted molecular therapies in patients with advanced MTC. While MTC is not the only neuroendocrine neoplasm in the thyroid gland, other neuroendocrine neoplasms in the thyroid include intrathyroidal thymic neuroendocrine neoplasms, intrathyroidal parathyroid neoplasms, and primary thyroid paragangliomas as well as metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. Therefore, the first responsibility of a pathologist is to distinguish MTC from other mimics using appropriate biomarkers. The second responsibility includes meticulous assessment of the status of angioinvasion (defined as tumor cells invading through a vessel wall and forming tumor-fibrin complexes, or intravascular tumor cells admixed with fibrin/thrombus), tumor necrosis, proliferative rate (mitotic count and Ki67 labeling index), and tumor grade (low- or high-grade) along with the tumor stage and the resection margins. Given the morphologic and proliferative heterogeneity in these neoplasms, an exhaustive sampling is strongly recommended. Routine molecular testing for pathogenic germline RET variants is typically performed in all patients with a diagnosis of MTC; however, multifocal C-cell hyperplasia in association with at least a single focus of MTC and/or multifocal C-cell neoplasia are morphological harbingers of germline RET alterations. It is of interest to assess the status of pathogenic molecular alterations involving genes other than RET like the MET variants in MTC families with no pathogenic germline RET variants. Furthermore, the status of somatic RET alterations should be determined in all advanced/progressive or metastatic diseases, especially when selective RET inhibitor therapy (e.g., selpercatinib or pralsetinib) is considered. While the role of routine SSTR2/5 immunohistochemistry remains to be further clarified, evidence suggests that patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-avid metastatic disease may also benefit from the option of 177Lu-DOTATATE peptide radionuclide receptor therapy. Finally, the authors of this review make a call to support the nomenclature change of MTC to C-cell neuroendocrine neoplasm to align this entity with the IARC/WHO taxonomy since MTCs represent epithelial neuroendocrine neoplasms of endoderm-derived C-cells.",Endocrine Pathology,"Chan Kwon Jung, Shipra Agarwal, Jen-Fan Hang, Dong-Jun Lim, Andrey Bychkov, Ozgur Mete",,English,"Neuroendocrine Tumors*/diagnosis/genetics; Medicine; Humans; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine*/diagnosis/genetics/pathology; Prognosis; Thyroid Neoplasms*/diagnosis/genetics/pathology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36890425,,"Biomarkers, C-cell neuroendocrine neoplasm, C-cells, Epigenetics, Genetics, Medullary thyroid carcinoma, Neuroendocrine neoplasm, Protein kinase inhibitors, RET inhibitors, Risk assessment, Thyroid cancer, Thyroid neoplasms","Jung CK, Agarwal S, Hang JF, Lim DJ, Bychkov A, Mete O.

Methods: We studied 55 patients treated with TKI for radioiodine-refractory or medullary thyroid cancer. The adrenal function was evaluated during follow-up by performing serum basal ACTH, and basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol. Results: Twenty-nine/55 (52.7%) patients developed subclinical AI during TKI treatment as demonstrated by a blunted cortisol response to ACTH stimulation. All cases showed normal values of serum sodium, potassium and blood pressure. All patients were immediately treated, and none showed an overt AI. Cases with AI were all negative for adrenal antibodies and did not show any adrenal gland alteration. Other causes of AI were excluded. The onset time of the AI, as measured in the subgroup with a first negative ACTH test, was < 12 months in 5/9 (55.6%), between 12 and 36 months in 2/9 (22.2%) and > 36 months in 2/9 (22.2%) cases. In our series, the only prognostic factor of AI was the elevated, although moderate, basal level of ACTH when the basal and stimulated cortisol were still normal. The glucocorticoid therapy improved fatigue in most patients. Conclusions: Subclinical AI can be developed in > 50% of advanced thyroid cancer patients treated with TKI. This AE can develop in a wide period ranging from < 12 to > 36 months. For this reason, AI must be looked for throughout the follow-up to be early recognized and treated.

Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, in collaboration with University Medical Center Groningen, was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper summarizes the company submission (CS), presents the ERG's critical review of the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence in the CS, highlights the key methodological considerations, and describes the development of the NICE guidance by the Appraisal Committee. The CS reported data from the ARROW trial. ARROW is a single-arm, multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort study in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC and other advanced solid tumors. The CS included both untreated and pre-treated RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients, among other disease types. The comparators in the untreated population were pembrolizumab + pemetrexed + chemotherapy and pembrolizumab monotherapy. The comparators for the pre-treated population were docetaxel monotherapy, docetaxel + nintedanib, and platinum-based chemotherapy ± pemetrexed. As no comparators were included in ARROW, an indirect treatment comparison was conducted to estimate relative effectiveness. The ERG's concerns included the immaturity of data, small sample size, and lack of comparative safety evidence. The ERG considers the clinical evidence presented to be insufficiently robust to inform the economic model. Even when all the ERG preferred assumptions were implemented in the model, uncertainty remained on a number of issues, such as the appropriateness of the hazard ratios and the methods and data used to derive them, long-term efficacy of pralsetinib, and direct evidence for health-related quality of life (HRQoL). NICE did not recommend pralsetinib within its marketing authorization for treating RET fusion-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults who have not had a RET inhibitor before. The uncertainty of the clinical evidence and the estimates of cost effectiveness were too high to be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources. Therefore, pralsetinib was not recommended for routine use.",PharmacoEconomics,"Mohamed N. M. T.

However, responses to these agents are commonly temporary and incomplete. Moreover, even patients with the same oncogenic driver gene can respond diversely to the same agent. Furthermore, the therapeutic role of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in oncogene-driven NSCLC remains unclear. Therefore, this review aimed to classify the management of NSCLC with driver mutations based on the gene subtype, concomitant mutation, and dynamic alternation. Then, we provide an overview of the resistant mechanism of target therapy occurring in targeted alternations ('target-dependent resistance') and in the parallel and downstream pathways ('target-independent resistance'). Thirdly, we discuss the effectiveness of ICIs for NSCLC with driver mutations and the combined therapeutic approaches that might reverse the immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment. Finally, we listed the emerging treatment strategies for the new oncogenic alternations, and proposed the perspective of NSCLC with driver mutations.

However, mechanisms of its progression remained unclear and new treatments against this disease are rapidly emerging. As a novel preclinical model, patient-derived organoid (PDO) can also be established from the patient’s tumor tissue and cultured in the laboratory, which preserves the key biological characteristics of the original tumor. Compared to the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of lung cancer, the culture success rate is improved, and the time and cost of model establishment are largely reduced. PDO is also expected to provide a more individual model to predict the efficacy of anti-cancer treatment in vitro. This paper summarizes the current application of PDO in the translational research of lung cancer.","Cellular oncology (Dordrecht, Netherlands)","Yin Li, Xinyu Gao, Chao Ni, Bing Zhao, Xinghua Cheng",,English,"Biomedical and Life Sciences; Organoids/pathology; Humans; Translational Research, Biomedical; Disease Models, Animal; Animals; Lung Neoplasms*/pathology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10205850,,"Co-culture, Lung cancer, Patient-derived organoid, Personalized therapy","Li Y, Gao X, Ni C, Zhao B, Cheng X.

PDTC must possess solid, trabecular, or insular growth and lack classic papillary-like nuclei; HGDTC can be of any architectural or nuclear morphology (follicular-like, papillary-like, oncocytic). Transformation may be accompanied by acquisition of high-risk mutations (such as TP53 or TERT promoter) on top of RAS-like or BRAF p.V600E-like (including NTRK-fusion) initial driver mutations. These carcinomas most frequently affect adults and often present with metastases (20-50%) or wide local invasion. As PDTC and HGDTC may be radioactive iodine resistant, post-surgical therapy may consist of external beam radiotherapy or targeted, mutation-dependent chemotherapy, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Over the past decade, rapid progress has also been made in the development of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), especially antagonistic antibodies targeting the PD-L1-PD-1 axis, for the treatment of NSCLC. Although many of the major oncogenic drivers of NSCLC are associated with intrinsic resistance to ICIs, patients with certain oncogene-driven subtypes of the disease that are highly responsive to specific targeted therapies might also derive benefit from immunotherapy. However, the development of effective immunotherapy approaches for oncogene-addicted NSCLC has been challenged by a lack of predictive biomarkers for patient selection and limited knowledge of how ICIs and oncogene-directed targeted therapies should be combined. Therefore, whether ICIs alone or with chemotherapy or even in combination with molecularly targeted agents would offer comparable benefit in the context of selected oncogenic driver alterations to that observed in the general unselected NSCLC population remains an open question. In this Review, we discuss the effects of oncogenic driver mutations on the efficacy of ICIs and the immune tumour microenvironment as well as the potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited to overcome the challenges of immunotherapy for oncogene-addicted NSCLC.",Nature reviews.

In addition, the therapeutic landscape of thyroid cancer has been expanded by targeted therapies based on molecular tumor profiles. Selective RET inhibitors such as selpercatinib and pralsetinib show high activity in DTC with RET fusions and MTC with RET mutations, respectively.

RESULTS: Of 54 meta-MTC patients, 34/54 were men, 44/54 sporadic (age-at-diagnosis 47 ± 17.4 years, range: 5-78). Distant metastases at diagnosis were present in 12/54 (≥2 loci in 8/12), 7/12 received TKIs; During follow-up metastases occurred in 42/54 (within 0.6-25 years from diagnosis, median 5 yrs). Locoregional therapies were administered to 44/54 (81.5%) and TKIs to 40/54 (74.1%). Vandetanib was administered in 30 patients (24 as first-line therapy). The median progression-free-survival, PFS) was 48 months (range 4-120), partial response (PR): 26.7%, stable disease (SD): 23.3%, progressive disease (PD): 50.0%, cancer-specific survival: 44.8%, (16 in ongoing-therapy). More favorable disease course was recorded in familial-MTC compared to sporadic (p = 0.02) and in those patients with serious-adverse-events (SAEs) under treatment (p = 0.027). Those with biochemical progression under vandetanib, later showed more frequently structural progression (p = 0.007). Ten patients received cabozantinib (8/10 as second-line therapy, median PFS:11 months (3-36 months), 8/10 died). Three RET-mutant patients received selpercatinib; all showed PR. Within the total follow-up period, the response to therapy was: PR: 8/54 (14.8%), SD: 15/54 (27.8%), PD: 31/54 (57.4%), cancer-specific survival 46.3%. Mortality was higher in older patients (≥60 years) compared to younger ones (<60 yrs) (83.3 vs 45.2%, p = 0.021). Outcome was better in familial-MTC vs sporadic (PR: 50 vs 6.8%, SD: 20 vs 29.5%, PD: 30 vs 59.1%, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-MTCs treatment results in disease stabilization in 42.6% during a median 10.5 year follow-up. Combination of locoregional and systemic therapies may result in more favorable PFS. Family history, younger age, SAEs may predict better response; biochemical escape under TKI needs to be followed-up closely as it may indicate disease progression.",Endocrine,"Katerina Saltiki, George Simeakis, Olga Karapanou, Stavroula A.

We provide the first case report of a RET-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) transformation into small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a mechanism of acquired resistance to pralsetinib. A 43-year-old patient presented with a RET-rearranged LUAD revealed by pleural effusion. After 14 months of response to pralsetinib, biopsy of a progressive pleural lesion found a phenotypic transformation into SCLC. Molecular analysis identified the same RET fusion and TP53 mutation in both primary adenocarcinoma and recurrence as SCLC. The patient achieved partial response after switch to carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy and presented with progression disease after 6 months. Histological transformation could be a mechanism of resistance to RET-TKIs and rebiopsy should be considered to adapt subsequent treatment.",Clinical Lung Cancer,"Alexia Gazeu, Mylena Aubert, Daniel Pissaloux, Sylvie Lantuejoul, Maurice Pérol, Nadia Ikhlef, Amine Bouhamama, Tatiana Franceschi, Aurélie Swalduz",,English,"Humans; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics; Small Cell Lung Carcinoma*/drug therapy/genetics/pathology; Pyridines/therapeutic use; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/drug therapy; Adenocarcinoma of Lung*/drug therapy/genetics; Adult; Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Lung Neoplasms*/drug therapy/genetics/pathology",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36437214,,"Histological transformation, Pralsetinib, RET-fusion, Resistance, small-cell lung carcinoma","Gazeu A, Aubert M, Pissaloux D, Lantuejoul S, Pérol M, Ikhlef N, Bouhamama A, Franceschi T, Swalduz A.

Pralsetinib is a recently approved drug for the treatment of RET-driven NSCLC and thyroid cancers. A single point mutation G810C at the C-lobe of the RET kinase causes pralsetinib resistance to this non-gatekeeper variant. However, the detailed mechanism remains poorly understood. METHODS: Here, multiple microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy calculations, and community network analysis were performed to reveal the mechanism of pralsetinib resistance to the RET G810C mutant. RESULTS: The simulations showed that the G810C mutation had a minor effect on the overall conformational dynamics of the RET kinase domain. Energetic analysis suggested that the G810C mutation reduced the binding affinity of pralsetinib to the mutant. Per-residue energy contribution and structural analyses revealed that the hydrogen bonding interactions between pralsetinib and the hinge residues Glu805 and Ala807 were disrupted in the G810C mutant, which were responsible for the decreased binding affinity of pralsetinib to the mutant.

The objective of this article is to review selpercatinib and pralsetinib in the context of RET-fusion-positive NSCLC. Data sources: The pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials were evaluated regarding the use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib as treatment for RET-fusion-positive NSCLC. Comparative studies, review articles and current studies on selpercatinib and pralsetinib in RET-fusion-positive NSCLC were searched on pubmed.org and scholar.google.com using “selpercatinib,” “pralsetinib,” and “NSCLC” as keywords. Product monographs were searched on google.ca and uptodate.com using the keywords “selpercatinib,” “pralsetinib,” and/or “monograph.” Data summary: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are orally administered highly selective RET inhibitors approved by the FDA following the accelerated approvals granted due to the pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials which evaluated selpercatinib and pralsetinib, respectively. Both drugs have shown efficacy for brain metastases and are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 through hepatic metabolism. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects of selpercatinib were hypertension, increased ALT level, and increased AST level while for pralsetinib, it was neutropenia, hypertension, and anemia. The safety profile shows similarities in severity and tolerability but additional monitoring for QT prolongation in patients on selpercatinib is recommended, compared to the risks of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis for patients on pralsetinib.

The receptor REarranged during Transfection (RET) plays an important role by ligand independent activation of kinase domain resulting in carcinogenesis. Presently, the treatment for RET driven NSCLC is limited to multiple kinase inhibitors. This situation necessitates the discovery of novel and potent RET specific inhibitors. Thus, we employed high throughput screening strategy to repurpose FDA approved compounds from DrugBank comprising of 2509 molecules. It is worth noting that the initial screening is accomplished with the aid of in-house machine learning model built using IC50 values corresponding to 2854 compounds obtained from BindingDB repository. A total of 497 compounds (19%) were predicted as actives by our generated model. Subsequent in silico validation process such as molecular docking, MMGBSA and density function theory analysis resulted in identification of two lead compounds named DB09313 and DB00471. The simulation study highlights the potency of DB00471 (Montelukast) as potential RET inhibitor among the investigated compounds. In the end, the half-minimal inhibitory activity of montelukast was also predicted against RET protein expressing LC-2/ad cell lines demonstrated significant anticancer activity. Collective analysis from our study highlights that montelukast could be a promising candidate for the management of RET specific NSCLC.","Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)","Priyanka Ramesh, Ramanathan Karuppasamy, Shanthi Veerappapillai",,English,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Molecular Docking Simulation; Humans; Clinical Sciences; Lung Neoplasms; Lung Neoplasms*/drug therapy/metabolism; Drug Repositioning; Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/drug therapy; Medicine; Medical and Health Sciences; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/metabolism/therapeutic use",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9769489,,"non-small cell lung cancer, cell lung cancer, lung cancer, RET inhibitors, total lung cancer cases, lung cancer cases, multiple kinase inhibitor, cause of mortality, drug repurposing strategy, AD cell lines, cancer cases, ligand-independent activation, repurposing strategy, kinase inhibitors, RET protein, significant anticancer activity, montelukast, cell lines, initial screening, cancer, inhibitors, independent activation, specific inhibitor, inhibitory activity, anticancer activity, IC50 values, lead compounds, morbidity, mortality, receptors, carcinogenesis, important role, FDA, study highlight, treatment, molecular docking, RET, total, kinase domain, activity, cause, potency, activation, screening, transfection, identification, management, cases, strategies, protein, study, role, MMGBSA, compounds, collective analysis, analysis, candidates, validation process, lines, promising candidate, discovery, docking, end, Active, highlights, aid, model, molecules, comprising, values, situation, domain, theory analysis, high throughput, process, repository, machine, simulation study, house machines, throughput","Ramesh P, Karuppasamy R, Veerappapillai S.

How sequential treatment with MKIs is conducted in Japanese clinical practice is unknown. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study used a Japanese administrative claims database (April 2008-September 2021). Patients with a confirmed TC subtype diagnosis of papillary (PTC), follicular (FTC), medullary (MTC), or anaplastic (ATC), who received MKI treatment after TC diagnosis within the index period (June 2014-August 2021), were included. Overall MKI treatment duration was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: The analysis population included 795 patients (PTC, N = 447; FTC, N = 86; MTC, N = 32; ATC, N = 230). Median age was ≥ 64 years; most patients (> 60%) were female except for the MTC subgroup (43.8%). First-line (1L) MKI treatment was mainly lenvatinib for PTC (81.7%), FTC (83.7%), and ATC (97.8%), and vandetanib for MTC (62.5%). Among patients discontinuing 1L MKI treatment and evaluable for subsequent therapy [PTC: 57.9% (259/447); FTC: 48.8% (42/86); MTC: 62.5% (20/32); ATC: 70.4% (162/230)], 26.3% (68/259), 21.4% (9/42), 50.0% (10/20), and 4.9% (8/162) of PTC, FTC, MTC, and ATC patients, respectively, received second-line (2L) treatment. Median (95% CI) overall MKI treatment duration was 21.2 (17.9-27.5), 43.9 (30.9-not assessable), 39.0 (17.7-not assessable), and 4.0 (3.0-4.8) months for PTC, FTC, MTC, and ATC, respectively.

However, acquired resistance mediated by secondary mutations in the solvent-front region of the kinase (e.g. G810C/S/R) becomes a major challenge for selective RET inhibitor therapies. Herein, we report a structure-based design of 1-methyl-3-((4-(quinolin-4-yloxy)phenyl)amino)-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide derivatives as new RET kinase inhibitors which are capable of suppressing the RETG810 C/R resistant mutants. One of the representative compounds, 8q, potently suppressed wild-type RET kinase with an IC50 value of 13.7 nM. It also strongly inhibited the proliferation of BaF3 cells stably expressing various oncogenic fusions of RET kinase with solvent-front mutations, e.g. CCDC6-RETG810C, CCDC6-RETG810R, KIF5B-RETG810C and KIF5B-RETG810R, with IC50 values of 15.4, 53.2, 54.2 and 120.0 nM, respectively. Furthermore, 8q dose-dependently inhibited the activation of RET and downstream signals and obviously triggered apoptosis in Ba/F3-CCDC6-RETG810 C/R cells. The compound also exhibited significant anti-tumor efficacy with a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) value of 66.9% at 30 mg/kg/day via i. p. in a Ba/F3-CCDC6-RETG810C xenograft mouse model.

Approximately 30% of PSCs have potentially targetable genomic alterations, but few studies have involved RET gene fusions, and corresponding targeted therapies are lacking. Case presentation: In this report, we describe a patient with PSC harboring a KIF5B-RET gene fusion who was initially diagnosed with stage IVb lung cancer. Due to the poor performance status, the patient was unable to tolerate any radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

This study focuses on screening compounds that inhibit RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) essential for RNA synthesis required for replication of positive-strand RNA viruses. Computational screening against RdRp using Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs identified ten prominent compounds with binding energies of more than - 10.00 kcal/mol, each a potential inhibitor of RdRp. These compounds' binding energy is comparable to known RdRp inhibitors remdesivir (IC50 = 10.09 μM, SI = 4.96) and molnupiravir (EC50 = 0.67 - 2.66 µM) and 0.32-2.03 µM). Remdesivir and molnupiravir have been tested in clinical trial and remain authorized for emergency use in the treatment of COVID-19. In docking simulations, selected compounds are bound to the substrate-binding pocket of RdRp and showed hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interaction. For molecular dynamics simulation, capmatinib, pralsetinib, ponatinib, and tedizolid phosphate were selected from the initial ten candidate compounds. MD simulation indicated that these compounds are stable at 50-ns MD simulation when bound to RdRp protein. The screen hit compounds, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and GS-441524, are bound in the substrate binding pocket with good binding-free energy. As a consequence, capmatinib, pralsetinib, ponatinib, and tedizolid phosphate are potential new inhibitors of RdRp protein with potential of limiting COVID-19 infection by blocking RNA synthesis.

ARROW study has demonstrated a new selective RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) shows remarkable and durable responses in RET-rearranged NCSLC. In this study mainly recruited patients with common fusion partners KIF5B and CCDC6. There is still a lack of definitive conclusions about effective of rare RET fusion variants to anti-RET therapies. Case report:: A Chinese 58-year-old female renal insufficient patient with no history of smoking was diagnosed as stage IIIA (T2N2M0) lung adenocarcinoma. Next-generation sequencing targeting 520 cancer-related genes was performed on the pleural effusion samples and revealed 2 novel RET fusions LINCO1264-RET and SEMA5A-RET, concomitant with a common CCDC6-RET. Management and outcome:: The patient was first treated with multiple lines of chemotherapy and switched to lenvatinib but failed to respond. Due to renal insufficiency, she subsequently received pralsetinib with gradually reduced dosages (400 mg-300 mg-200 mg-100 mg qd) and achieved a partial response (PR) lasting for more than 10 months, accompanied by the declined allele frequencies of all 3 RET fusions. Discussion/conclusions:: We reported the first case of the pralsetinib efficacy in NSCLC with 3 concurrent RET fusions.

In a pivotal phase 1/2 clinical trial in this population, selpercatinib treatment was associated with robust and durable responses, including intracranial responses, in patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, as well as in treatment-naïve patients. Selpercatinib had a manageable tolerability profile and an acceptable safety profile; adverse events could generally be managed with dose reductions and only a small proportion of patients discontinued selpercatinib due to treatment-related adverse events. The most common treatment-related adverse events that were grade 3-4 in severity were hypertension, elevated alanine aminotransferase and elevated aspartate aminotransferase. Thus, currently available evidence suggests that selpercatinib is a promising new RET-targeted therapy option for patients with advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC. plain-language-summary: Targeted therapy against the oncogenic driver in tumours carrying such mutations offers the potential for greater anti-tumour efficacy and limited off-target toxicity. Fusion of the rearranged during transfection (RET) gene with another gene is one such driver in a small subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Selpercatinib (Retevmo®/Retsevmo®) is a selective RET kinase inhibitor that is taken orally for the treatment of advanced NSCLC with an RET gene fusion. In the pivotal clinical trial in these patients, selpercatinib demonstrated durable responses both in patients previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and patients with no prior treatment. Selpercatinib also demonstrated anti-tumour activity against brain metastases associated with NSCLC. Adverse events with selpercatinib were generally manageable with dose reductions and few patients discontinued selpercatinib due to adverse effects.

Pralsetinib, a highly potent, oral, central nervous system-penetrant, selective RET inhibitor, previously demonstrated clinical activity in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC in the phase I/II ARROW study, including among treatment-naive patients. We report an updated analysis from the ARROW study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ARROW is a multi-cohort, open-label, phase I/II study. Eligible patients were ≥18 years of age with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 (later 0-1). Patients initiated pralsetinib at the recommended phase II dose of 400 mg once daily until disease progression, intolerance, consent withdrawal, or investigator's decision. The co-primary endpoints (phase II) were overall response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review and safety. RESULTS: Between 17 March 2017 and 6 November 2020 (data cut-off), 281 patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC were enrolled. The ORR was 72% [54/75; 95% confidence interval (CI) 60% to 82%] for treatment-naive patients and 59% (80/136; 95% CI 50% to 67%) for patients with prior platinum-based chemotherapy (enrolment cut-off for efficacy analysis: 22 May 2020); median duration of response was not reached for treatment-naive patients and 22.3 months for prior platinum-based chemotherapy patients. Tumour shrinkage was observed in all treatment-naive patients and in 97% of patients with prior platinum-based chemotherapy; median progression-free survival was 13.0 and 16.5 months, respectively. In patients with measurable intracranial metastases, the intracranial response rate was 70% (7/10; 95% CI 35% to 93%); all had received prior systemic treatment. In treatment-naive patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC who initiated pralsetinib by the data cut-off (n = 116), the most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were neutropenia (18%), hypertension (10%), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (9%), and lymphopenia (9%). Overall, 7% (20/281) discontinued due to TRAEs. CONCLUSIONS: Pralsetinib treatment produced robust efficacy and was generally well tolerated in treatment-naive patients with advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC.

Next-generation sequencing can detect cancer-specific gene mutations, and molecular-targeted drugs can be designed to be effective for one or more specific gene mutations. For patients with special site metastases, it is particularly important to use appropriate samples for genetic profiling. This study aimed to determine whether genomic profiling using ASC and PE is effective in detecting genetic mutations. Methods: Tissues, plasma, ascites (ASC) supernatants, and pleural effusion (PE) samples from gastrointestinal cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis and lung cancer patients with pleural metastasis were collected for comprehensive genomic profiling. The samples were subjected to next-generation sequencing using a panel of 59 or 1021 cancer-relevant genes panel. Results: A total of 156 tissues, 188 plasma samples, 45 ASC supernatants, and 1 PE samples from 304 gastrointestinal cancer patients and 446 PE supernatants, 122 tissues, 389 plasma samples, and 45 PE sediments from 407 lung cancer patients were analyzed. The MSAF was significantly higher in ASC and PE supernatant than that in plasma ctDNA (50.00% vs. 3.00%, p < 0.0001 and 28.5% vs. 1.30%, p < 0.0001, respectively). The ASC supernatant had a higher actionable mutation rate and more actionable alterations than the plasma ctDNA in 26 paired samples. The PE supernatant had a higher total actionable mutation rate than plasma (80.3% vs. 48.4%, p < 0.05). The PE supernatant had a higher frequency of uncommon variations than the plasma regardless of distant organ metastasis.

Digital pathology data provides a unique insight into the spatial composition of the TME. Various spatial metrics and machine learning approaches were proposed for prediction of either patient survival or gene mutations from this data. Still, these approaches are limited in the scope of analyzed features and in their explainability, and as such fail to transfer to clinical practice. Methods: Here, we generated 23,199 image patches from 26 hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E)-stained lung cancer tissue sections and annotated them into 9 different tissue classes. Using this dataset, we trained a deep neural network ARA-CNN. Next, we applied the trained network to segment 467 lung cancer H&E images from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We used the segmented images to compute human-interpretable features reflecting the heterogeneous composition of the TME, and successfully utilized them to predict patient survival and cancer gene mutations. Results: We achieved per-class AUC ranging from 0.72 to 0.99 for classifying tissue types in lung cancer with ARA-CNN. Machine learning models trained on the proposed human-interpretable features achieved a c-index of 0.723 in the task of survival prediction and AUC up to 73.5% for PDGFRB in the task of mutation classification. Conclusions: We presented a framework that accurately predicted survival and gene mutations in lung adenocarcinoma patients based on human-interpretable features extracted from H&E slides. Our approach can provide important insights for designing novel cancer treatments, by linking the spatial structure of the TME in lung adenocarcinoma to gene mutations and patient survival. It can also expand our understanding of the effects that the TME has on tumor evolutionary processes.

Their basal function is essential for maintaining normal cell growth and differentiation. However, aberrant activation of PTKs caused by various factors can deviate cell function from the expected trajectory to an abnormal growth state, leading to carcinogenesis. Inhibiting the aberrant PTK function could inhibit tumor growth. Therefore, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), target-specific inhibitors of PTKs, have been used in treating malignant tumors and play a significant role in targeted therapy of cancer. Currently, drug resistance is the main reason for limiting TKIs efficacy of cancer. The increasing studies indicated that tumor microenvironment, cell death resistance, tumor metabolism, epigenetic modification and abnormal metabolism of TKIs were deeply involved in tumor development and TKI resistance, besides the abnormal activation of PTK-related signaling pathways involved in gene mutations. Accordingly, it is of great significance to study the underlying mechanisms of TKIs resistance and find solutions to reverse TKIs resistance for improving TKIs efficacy of cancer.

While activating RET rearrangements are found in NSCLC patients harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) genetic alterations at resistance to EGFR inhibitors, the extent to which co-occurring genomic alterations exist and how they might affect prognosis or therapy response is poorly understood. Methods: Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to assess 380 baseline patients with primary RET fusions and 71 EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients who acquired RET fusions after developing resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Results: Primary RET fusions were more likely associated with females and younger age, with KIF5B being the predominant fusion partner. In baseline patients, both SMAD4 (5.3% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.044) and MYC copy-number gain variants (6.9% vs. 0.0%, P = 0.009) were more frequently co-mutated with KIF5B-RET than CCDC6-RET. By contrast, CDKN2A (11.3% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.003) mutations were significantly enriched in CCDC6-RET-rearranged baseline patients. A significant increase in the proportion of CCDC6-RET was observed in acquired RET-rearranged patients (47.3% vs. 22.5%, P < 0.001). The median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients harboring RB1 and TP53 double-mutations (5.5 vs. 10.0 months, P = 0.020) or ERBB2 amplification (5.6 vs. 10.0 months, P = 0.041) was significantly shorter than the wild-type counterparts. Moreover, we identified that RET fusions were more likely associated with acquired resistance (AR) to third-generation EGFR-TKIs than previous generations of EGFR-TKIs. Conclusions: In conclusion, we depicted the mutational profiles of NSCLC patients who harbor RET fusions at baseline or after resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Furthermore, our results suggest that RET fusions mediate secondary resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKIs and might be associated with poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC.",Journal of Translational Medicine,"Chunyue Wang, Zhenlong Zhang, Yulan Sun, Song Wang, Mengmeng Wu, Qiuxiang Ou, Yang Xu, Zhiming Chen, Yang Shao, Hong Liu, Peifeng Hou",,English,"Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret; Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Biomedical and Life Sciences; Humans; ErbB Receptors/genetics/metabolism; Female; Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics*/metabolism; Lung Neoplasms; ErbB Receptors; Mutation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Oncogenes; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/drug therapy/genetics; Medical and Health Sciences; Lung Neoplasms*/drug therapy/genetics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9441062,,"non-small cell lung cancer, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, progression-free survival, cell lung cancer, RET fusions, baseline patient, NSCLC patients, CCDC6-RET, lung cancer, oncogenic drivers, median progression-free survival, co-occurring genomic alterations, kinase inhibitors, rare oncogenic drivers, next-generation sequencing, primary oncogenic driver, poor prognosis, KIF5B-RET, therapy response, ERBB2 amplification, secondary resistance, patients, younger age, RET rearrangements, ConclusionsIn conclusion, EGFR inhibitors, wild-type counterparts, mutational profile, genetic alterations, genomic alterations, prognosis, significant increase, cancer, EGFR, inhibitors, alterations, fusion partner, baseline, TP53, survival, age, resistance, SMAD4, RET, Rb1, females, conclusion, fusion, mutations, proportion, response, sequencing, variants, increase, contrast, profile, amplification, extent, partners, results, rearrangement, counterparts, drivers, previous generations, generation","Wang C, Zhang Z, Sun Y, Wang S, Wu M, Ou Q, Xu Y, Chen Z, Shao Y, Liu H, Hou P.

Pralsetinib is a potent, selective inhibitor of RET receptor tyrosine kinase. ARROW (NCT03037385, ongoing) was designed to evaluate pralsetinib efficacy and safety in patients with advanced RET-altered solid tumors. Twenty-nine patients with 12 different RET fusion–positive solid tumor types, excluding non-small-cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer, who had previously received or were not candidates for standard therapies, were enrolled. The most common RET fusion partners in 23 efficacy-evaluable patients were CCDC6 (26%), KIF5B (26%) and NCOA4 (13%). Overall response rate, the primary endpoint, was 57% (95% confidence interval, 35–77) among these patients. Responses were observed regardless of tumor type or RET fusion partner. Median duration of response, progression-free survival and overall survival were 12 months, 7 months and 14 months, respectively. The most common grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (31%) and anemia (14%).

Recently, histological grading has been applied to medullary thyroid carcinoma by the Ki-67 index, mitotic figures, and tumor necrosis. However, the interrelation of PD-L1 expression, the Ki-67 index, and major genetic alterations of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma has not been fully reported. We examined the expression of PD-L1 (SP142 and 22C3) and the Ki-67 index immunohistologically and detected the major genetic alterations by next-generation sequencing in a cohort of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas, studied their survival impact, and discussed their interrelation. We identified that a high Ki-67 index (> 2%) and positive RET M918T mutation were correlated with poor disease-free survival but were not correlated with PD-L1 expression. All PD-L1 positive tumors were RET M918T mutation negative, and PD-L1 expression was positively correlated with HRAS mutation. The Ki-67 index was correlated with neither PD-L1 expression nor major genetic alterations.

Selective RET inhibitors are setting a new paradigm in RET-driven NSCLC. However, the real-world treatment patterns, outcomes and toxicity remain largely unknown. Methods: Data from RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients treated in our centre were retrospectively analysed. Of them, patients diagnosed before and after August 2018 were included in analysis of treatment patterns; and patients received selective RET inhibitors were eligible for analysis of adverse events (AEs). Results: Patients diagnosed before August 2018 (n = 30) predominantly received chemotherapy and immunotherapy (83%) as initial therapy, while patients diagnosed after August 2018 (n = 39) mainly received selective RET inhibitors (38.5% at first-line; 50.0% at second-line). In the total 69 patients, overall survival (OS) was prolonged in patients treated with selective RET inhibitors versus untreated patients (median 34.3 versus 17.5 months; p = 0.002) during a median follow-up of 28.7 months. But there was no difference between patients treated with immunotherapy versus untreated patients. In the 38 patients received selective RET inhibition, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11.9 months. AEs ≥ grade 3 occurred in 42.1% patients and were not associated with PFS (p = 0.63) or OS (p = 0.60). Haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 occurred in 31.6% patients and was the leading cause of drug discontinuation. Conclusion: Selective RET inhibitors are increasingly being adopted into clinical practice and are associated with improved OS.

Before a few decades back, conventional chemotherapy was the most chosen treatment option for NSCLC but with side effects. Now, the treatment approaches have shifted to a new trend, targeted therapy, and a better treatment strategy with minimal side effects compared to chemotherapy. Advances in technologies and understanding the pathways lead to the discovery of new targets and through which it is possible to improve treatment outcomes and patient compliance. Unlike chemotherapy, targeted therapy focuses on the tumor cells and does not produce toxicity to healthy cells. The last two decades were very crucial in the development of many small molecules with the capability to target-specific proteins or genes in the disease progression pathway. Although the targeted therapy approach was a gemstone with many successful drugs for the treatment of NSCLC, various resistance mechanisms and activation of bypass signaling pathways put many of these drugs in the trash. In this review, we will discuss the major targeted proteins involved in NSCLC as well as the inhibitor drugs developed to target them for now and along with the future directions.Graphical abstract","Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)","Ajay P.

This review of cases was conducted to assess clinical implications and functionality of the program, to identify current limitations and to inform future directions of these efforts.Methods: Charts, molecular profiles, and tumor board decisions of the first 1000 consecutive cases (01/2016–03/2020) were reviewed. Descriptive statistics were applied to describe relevant findings.Results: Of the first 1000 patients presented to the MTB; 914 patients received comprehensive genomic profiling. Median age of patients was 56 years and 58% were female. The most prevalent diagnoses were breast (16%) and colorectal cancer (10%). Different types of targeted or genome-wide sequencing assays were used; most of them offered by the local department of pathology. Testing was technically successful in 88%. In 41% of cases, a genomic alteration triggered a therapeutic recommendation. The fraction of patients receiving a tumor board recommendation differed significantly between malignancies ranging from over 50% in breast or biliary tract to less than 30% in pancreatic cancers. Based on a retrospective chart review, 17% of patients with an MTB recommendation received appropriate treatment.Conclusion: Based on these retrospective analyses, patients with certain malignancies (breast and biliary tract cancer) tend to be more likely to have actionable variants.

Using real-world data (RWD) to construct control arms for single-arm trials provides an option for comparative data. However, non-randomised treatment comparisons have the potential to be biased and cause concern for decision-makers. Using the example of pralsetinib from a RET fusion-positive aNSCLC single-arm trial (NCT03037385), we demonstrate a relative survival benefit when compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab with chemotherapy RWD cohorts. Quantitative bias analyses show that results for the RWD-trial comparisons are robust to data missingness, potential poorer outcomes in RWD and residual confounding. Overall, the study provides evidence in favour of pralsetinib as a first-line treatment for RET fusion-positive aNSCLC. The quantification of potential bias performed in this study can be used as a template for future studies of this nature.",Nature Communications,"Sanjay Popat, Stephen V.

Wild-type (WT) and p.C630 deletion RET were expressed in HEK 293T cells. Activation of phosphorylation of the crucial tyrosine-905 of RET and MAPK/ERK was analyzed by Western blotting. The effect of RET mutants on cell viability and colony formation ability was determined by CCK8 assay and a colony forming assay.Results: NGS-Panel sequencing revealed a 3-nucleotide/1-amino acid C630 in-frame deletion in exon 11 of RET (c.1887_1889delGTG p.C630del). In vitro expression showed that phosphorylation of the crucial tyrosine 905 was much stronger in the p.C630del RET mutant than in WT RET, indicating ligand-independent activation of the Ret protein tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, p.C630del RET mutant induced strong activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. In addition, p.C630del RET mutant cells exhibited increased HEK 293T cell viability and colony formation compared with WT RET cells. Pralsetinib (BLU-667), a highly selective RET inhibitor, inhibited the viability of WT RET and p.C630del RET mutant-transfected HEK 293T cells (IC50s: 18.54 and 16.49 µM after treatment for 24 hours), followed by inhibition of the RET-induced MAPK/ERK pathway.Conclusion: The finding in our patient with MTC was a 3-base-pair deletion in exon 11 of RET, a p.C630 deletion not previously reported. The p.C630del RET stimulates cell proliferation by increasing ligand-independent phosphorylation and activation of MAPK/ERK pathway, demonstrating the pathogenic nature of the mutation.

Here, we hypothesized that increased expression of endogenous GDNF could induce dopaminergic abnormalities that resemble those seen in schizophrenia. To test the impact of GDNF elevation, without inducing adverse effects caused by ectopic overexpression, we developed a novel in vivo approach to conditionally increase endogenous GDNF expression. We found that a 2–3-fold increase in endogenous GDNF in the brain was sufficient to induce molecular, cellular, and functional changes in dopamine signalling in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, including increased striatal presynaptic dopamine levels and reduction of dopamine in prefrontal cortex. Mechanistically, we identified adenosine A2a receptor (A2AR), a G-protein coupled receptor that modulates dopaminergic signalling, as a possible mediator of GDNF-driven dopaminergic abnormalities. We further showed that pharmacological inhibition of A2AR with istradefylline partially normalised striatal GDNF and striatal and cortical dopamine levels in mice. Lastly, we found that GDNF levels are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of first episode psychosis patients, and in post-mortem striatum of schizophrenia patients. Our results reveal a possible contributor for increased striatal dopamine signalling in a subgroup of schizophrenia patients and suggest that GDNF—A2AR crosstalk may regulate dopamine function in a therapeutically targetable manner.",Molecular Psychiatry,"Kärt Mätlik, Daniel R.

Early prediction of resistance mechanisms to investigational drugs may facilitate subsequent drug and trial designs. This study aims to predict potential mutations inducing resistance to TPX-0046. We conducted an in-silico analysis of TPX-0046 macrocyclic structure and predicted the binding mode on RET.

We conducted docking simulations to evaluate impact of mutations on TPX-0046 binding. TPX-0046 binding mode on RET appears to not be influenced by Solventfront G810X mutation presence. Bulky Gatekeeper V804X mutations affect predicted TPX-0046 binding mode. Mutations in Beta 7 strand region L881F and xDFG S891L impair TPX-0046 docking.

Pralsetinib (Gavreto®) is an orally-administered, next-generation, small-molecule selective RET inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of RET fusion-positive metastatic NSCLC. In the pivotal phase I/II ARROW trial, pralsetinib demonstrated rapid and durable anti-tumour activity in patients with advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy or were treatment-naïve. Pralsetinib also showed clinical activity against intracranial metastases arising from NSCLC. Pralsetinib had a manageable tolerability profile, with the most common grade 3 treatment-related adverse events being neutropenia, hypertension, anaemia and decreased white blood cell count. Currently available data indicate that pralsetinib is a promising new targeted treatment option for patients with advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC. plain-language-summary: RET fusions are known to drive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a small subset of patients. Non-RET-specific multikinase inhibitors have been evaluated as targeted therapy for these patients in clinical trials, with limited success. Pralsetinib (Gavreto®) is an oral drug that directly and selectively inhibits the RET tyrosine kinase activity and is recently approved for the treatment of RET-driven NSCLC. In the pivotal ARROW trial, pralsetinib as first- or subsequent-line therapy showed rapid and durable clinical activity in patients with advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC.

Quite the contrary, with a total of 50 new drugs, 2021 belongs to the most successful FDA years. We assign these new drugs to one of three levels of innovation: (1) first drug against a condition (“first-in-indication”), (2) first drug using a novel molecular mechanism (“first-in-class”), and (3) “next-in-class”, i.e., a drug using an already exploited molecular mechanism. We identify 21 first-in-class, 28 next-in-class, and only one first-in-indication drugs. By treatment area, the largest group is once again cancer drugs, many of which target specific genetic alterations. Every second drug approved in 2021 targets an orphan disease, half of them being cancers.

Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are found in about a third of patients with advanced NSCLC, and the approval of first-generation EGFR targeted kinase inhibitors significantly improved survival when compared with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (PBC), the previous standard of care. Inevitably, selective pressure from first-generation EGFR inhibitors led to acquired resistance mechanisms, such as the T790M mutation. The advent of third-generation EGFR inhibitors (e.g., osimertinib) successfully overcame the T790M resistance mechanism, and osimertinib subsequently became the first-line therapy for EGFR mutant NSCLC. Currently, research in EGFR mutant NSCLC is primarily focused on targeting resistance mechanisms to osimertinib. Over the past several years, many important acquired and intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib have been identified. Acquired resistance mechanisms include C797X, mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) amplification, HER2/HER3 amplification, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway mutations, RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway mutations, cell–cycle gene alterations, oncogenic fusions, and histologic transformations. An important intrinsic resistance mechanism to osimertinib is the EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation, which is sensitive to the newly Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor mobocertinib and the EGFR/MET bispecific antibody amivantamab. This review article aims to (1) summarize the advances in the treatment of EGFR mutant NSCLC, (2) delineate known resistance mechanisms to the current first-line therapy, osimertinib, and (3) describe the development of targeted drugs that aim to overcome these resistance mechanisms.",Drugs,"Manan P.

The oncogenic RET fusions could lead to constitutive kinase activation and oncogenesis. Methods: 1746 Chinese NSCLC patients were analyzed in this study. Tumor tissues were collected, and were formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and archived. Peripheral blood (PB) samples were also collected from each patient as control. In addition, we selected 17 of them for cfDNA NGS testing and 14 tumor samples for immunohistochemistry testing using PD-L1 rabbit monoclonal antibody, clones 28-8 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Results: Of the 1746 NSCLC cases, RET rearrangements were identified in 25 cases (1.43%) with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, of which 20 (80%) were female. We found that 14 out of 25 patients had an KIF5B-RET fusion, with KIF5B exon15-RET exon12, KIF5B exon23-RET exon12, and KIF5B exon24-RET exon11 detected in 14, 3, and 1 patients, respectively. We also identified one novel RET fusion partner PLCE1 and 4 intergenic-breakpoint fusions. Conclusion: In this study, using the hybrid capture based next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, we revealed the genomic profiling for the patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC.

The objective of this study was to describe patient characteristics, biomarker testing, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes among patients with advanced/metastatic MTC in a real-world setting in the United States and to identify potential gaps in the care of these patients. Methods: Selected oncologists retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients aged ≥ 12 years diagnosed with advanced MTC. Patients must have initiated ≥ 1 line of systemic treatment for advanced/metastatic MTC between January 2013–December 2018 to be eligible. Patient characteristics, biomarker testing, and treatment patterns were summarized descriptively; progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results: The 203 patients included in this study had a mean (SD) age of 52.2 (10.4) years; mean (SD) duration of follow-up from start of first-line treatment was 24.5 (16.0) months. Most patients (82.8%) were initially diagnosed with stage IVA, IVB, or IVC disease. Among all patients, 121 (59.6%) had testing for RET mutations, of whom 37.2% had RET-mutant MTC. The RET-mutation type was reported for 28 patients; the most common mutations reported were M918T (64.3%) and C634R (32.1%). Of the 203 patients, 75.9% received only one line of systemic treatment for advanced disease, and 36% were still undergoing first-line therapy at the time of data extraction. Cabozantinib (30.0%), vandetanib (30.0%), sorafenib (17.2%), and lenvatinib (4.9%) were the most common first-line treatments. Among 49 patients who received second-line treatment, most received cabozantinib (22.4%), vandetanib (20.4%), lenvatinib (12.2%), or sunitinib (12.2%). Median PFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) from start of first- and second-line treatments was 26.6 months (20.8–60.8) and 15.3 months (6.6-not estimable [NE]), respectively. Median OS from initiation of first- and second-line treatment was 63.8 months (46.3-NE) and 22.4 months (12.4-NE), respectively. Conclusions: For the treatment of advanced/metastatic MTC, no specific preference of sequencing systemic agents was observed in the first- and second-line settings.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% to 85% of all lung cancers. Thyroid cancer, while generally not as lethal as lung cancer, has a large prevalent population and a rapidly increasing incidence in the United States. Pralsetinib is a highly potent, selective rearranged during transfection (RET) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of RET-positive NSCLC and thyroid cancer tumors. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the budget impact of adding pralsetinib to a 1 million-member US health plan formulary for the treatment of patients with metastatic RET fusion-positive NSCLC, advanced or metastatic RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), or advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer (non-MTC). METHODS: A budget impact model with a 3-year time horizon was developed in Microsoft Excel to estimate the number of eligible RET-positive NSCLC and thyroid cancer patients in a plan and quantify associated treatment costs (2020 USD). Comparators in the analyses included pralsetinib, selpercatinib, and cabozantinib, as well as indication-specific use of pembrolizumab, pemetrexed/carboplatin combination, vandetanib, lenvatinib, and sorafenib. Drug acquisition, molecular testing, treatment monitoring, and adverse event management costs were included to estimate total annual costs and per-member per-month (PMPM) costs in current (without pralsetinib) and potential future market scenarios, where pralsetinib is assumed to split the projected RET inhibitor market share with selpercatinib. The number of treated patients was based on age- and sex-adjusted incidence of disease, the proportion of patients diagnosed with advanced or metastatic disease, and projected RET testing rates. Treatment duration was based on progression-free survival or duration of response data from clinical trials. Medical resources were monetized using standardized sources such as Medicare reimbursement and wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). RESULTS: The model estimated that there would be approximately 6 new treatment-eligible patients in a 1 million-member plan annually. Monthly WAC is $19,243 for pralsetinib and $20,600 for selpercatinib at the recommended starting dose. Adoption of pralsetinib, with corresponding increases in pralsetinib market share, would be slightly cost saving to a payer, decreasing the overall budget impact to the health plan by $49,985 in year 3 (-$0.0042 PMPM; -$0.0030, -$0.0006, and -$0.0005 for NSCLC, MTC, and thyroid cancer [non-MTC], respectively). In year 3, drug costs were the key driver of total costs (~80%-98%) and cost savings. All other medical resource categories were cost-neutral or nominally cost saving or additive in the budget impact analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying the budget impact associated with the adoption of new targeted precision therapies is an important consideration for payers. For eligible NSCLC and thyroid cancer patients, our analysis suggests that adoption of pralsetinib is expected to result in modest cost savings for US payers.

Luminal subtype tumors have the best prognosis, and patients benefit from endocrine therapy. However, resistance to endocrine therapies in BC is an obstacle to successful treatment, and novel biomarkers are needed to understand and overcome this mechanism. The RET, BCAR1, and BCAR3 genes may be associated with BC progression and endocrine resistance. METHODS: Aiming to evaluate the expression profile and prognostic value of RET, BCAR1, and BCAR3, we performed immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing a cohort of 361 Luminal subtype BC. RESULTS: Low expression levels of these three proteins were predominantly observed. BCAR1 expression was correlated with nuclear grade (p = 0.057), and BCAR3 expression was correlated with lymph node status (p = 0.011) and response to hormonal therapy (p = 0.021). Further, low expression of either BCAR1 or BCAR3 was significantly associated with poor prognosis (p = 0.005; p = 0.042). Pairwise analysis showed that patients with tumors with low BCAR1/low BCAR3 expression had a poorer overall survival (p = 0.013), and the low BCAR3 expression had the worst prognosis with RET high expression stratifying these patients into two different groups. Regarding the response to hormonal therapy, non-responder patients presented lower expression of RET in comparison to the responder group (p = 0.035). Additionally, the low BCAR1 expression patients had poorer outcomes than BCAR1 high (p = 0.015).

Summary: RET fusion–positive NSCLC is a rare cancer caused by chromosomal rearrangements that lead to fusions of the RET gene with other genes, such as KIF5B and CCDC6. Until recently, patients were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy or multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, because of their nonspecific mechanism of action, these drugs did not have high response rates. In September 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved pralsetinib, the first once-daily oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for patients with metastatic RET fusion–positive NSCLC. Pralsetinib has been demonstrated to have response rates of 57% and 70% in patients who were previously treated with platinum chemotherapy and patients who were treatment naive, respectively. Clinicians using pralsetinib should monitor for fatigue, hepatotoxicity, hemorrhagic events, hypertension, myelosuppression, pyrexia, and respiratory infections, as these may require treatment interruption, dose reduction, or treatment discontinuation. Conclusion: Pralsetinib is a unique targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with RET fusion–positive metastatic NSCLC who may desire a once-daily regimen.",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,"Ly Nguyen, Shanada Monestime","University of North Texas Health Science Center, Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine, Fort Worth, TX, USA Miami Cancer Institute, Baptist Health South Florida, Miami, FL, USA",English,"Lung Neoplasms*/drug therapy/genetics; Pyridines/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics; Humans; Pyrazoles/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/drug therapy/genetics",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34864862,,"RET fusions, biomarker, non–small-cell lung carcinoma, pralsetinib, precision medicine, targeted therapy","Nguyen L, Monestime S.

As a novel target agent, however, the safety of pralsetinib remains to be determined. Herein, we present two cases of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) that developed during pralsetinib therapy. METHODS: From April 2020, we administered pralsetinib to a total of 10 patients with RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer under the compassionate use program. We retrospectively analysed the clinical efficacy of and adverse events related to pralsetinib therapy. RESULTS: Of the nine patients with measurable lesions, seven achieved a partial response. Additionally, one patient without measurable lesions also showed a clinical response. As of January 8, 2021, nine patients were still receiving pralsetinib therapy, while only one had discontinued pralsetinib therapy. Most adverse events were mild and manageable. However, two patients experienced extrapulmonary TB shortly after starting pralsetinib. The disease was well controlled with anti-TB medication, and the cancer lesions were managed through ongoing pralsetinib therapy. CONCLUSION: The development of TB during pralsetinib therapy is worth noting, although further large studies are required to demonstrate definitive relationship between causality and underlying mechanism.","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)","Yong-Pyo Lee, Byeong-Ho Jeong, Yeonghee Eun, Cheol-In Kang, Sehhoon Park, Hyun Ae Jung, Se-Hoon Lee, Jin Seok Ahn, Myung-Ju Ahn, Keunchil Park, Jong-Mu Sun",,English,"Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy*/genetics; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics; Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects; Humans; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy*/genetics; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics; Molecular Targeted Therapy/adverse effects/methods; Pyridines/adverse effects*; Tuberculosis/chemically induced*; Pyrimidines/adverse effects*; Pyrazoles/adverse effects*; Female; Republic of Korea; Middle Aged",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34753013,,"JAK1 pathway, Non-small cell lung cancer, Pralsetinib, RET, Tuberculosis","Lee YP, Jeong BH, Eun Y, Kang CI, Park S, Jung HA, Lee SH, Ahn JS, Ahn MJ, Park K, Sun JM.

Multi-Kinase Inhibitors (MKI) have been approved by FDA, but limited efficacies and side effects make them uneasy to tolerate. Pralsetinib is an oral highly selective RET inhibitor drug that has been generated and clinically validated to have higher potency and less toxicity. AREAS COVERED: The present paper offers a brief summary of RET-related thyroid cancer genetics, an overview of the preclinical development of pralsetinib and reviews its clinical validation in the treatment of thyroid cancer. EXPERT OPINION: Pralsetinib is a new generation oral treatment that has been approved by the FDA for patients with RET-mutated thyroid cancer. Pralsetinib showed a safer toxicity profile compared to previously approved MKI, probably due to lower inhibition of other tyrosine kinases, especially VEGFR. The approval study ARROW trial showed that patients with RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer had a better overall response rate to pralsetinib compared to standard-of-care treatments. Additional clinical trials or data enrichment of existing databases are desirable in order to verify and further describe the clinical benefit of pralsetinib in such patients to fully understand its pharmacological profile.",Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery,"Pietro Locantore, Roberto Novizio, Andrea Corsello, Rosa Maria Paragliola, Alfredo Pontecorvi, Salvatore Maria Corsello","Department of Translational Medicine and Surgery, Unit of Endocrinology – Università Cattolica Del Sacro Cuore, Fondazione Policlinico “Gemelli”, Irccs, Rome, Italy",English,"Pyrimidines; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/drug therapy; Pyridines; Pyrazoles; Humans; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/genetics/therapeutic use; Lung Neoplasms*/drug therapy; Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects; Thyroid Neoplasms*/drug therapy; Antineoplastic Agents*/adverse effects",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34702125,,"Pralsetinib, RET, thyroid cancer, tyrosine kinase inhibitor","Locantore P, Novizio R, Corsello A, Paragliola RM, Pontecorvi A, Corsello SM.

The discovery of actionable driver mutations has led to the development of an impressive number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase (ALK) rearrangements, and other rare molecular alterations in patients bearing metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the brain, with remarkable results in terms of intracranial disease control and overall survival. Moreover, these drugs may delay the use of local therapies, such as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). New drugs with higher molecular specificity and ability to cross the CNS barriers (BBB, BTB and blood-CSF) are being developed. Two major issues are related to targeted therapies. First, the emergence of a resistance is a common event, and a deeper understanding of molecular pathways that are involved is critical for the successful development of effective new targeted agents. Second, an early detection of tumor progression is of utmost importance to avoid the prolongation of an ineffective therapy while changing to another drug. In order to monitor over time the treatment to targeted therapies, liquid biopsy, that allows the detection in biofluids of either circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or exosomes, is increasingly employed in clinical trials: with respect to BM the monitoring of both blood and CSF is necessary. Also, radiomics is being developed to predict the mutational status of the BM on MRI.For patients without druggable mutations or who do not respond to targeted agents, immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors is increasingly employed, alone or in combination with radiotherapy. Pseudoprogression after immunotherapy alone maybe a challenge for several months after the start of treatment, and the same is true for radionecrosis after the combination of immunotherapy and SRS. In this regard, the value of advanced MRI techniques and PET imaging for a better distinction of pseudoprogression/radionecrosis and true tumor progression is promising, but needs validation in large prospective datasets. Last, a new frontier in the near future will be chemoprevention (primary and secondary), but we need to identify among solid tumors those subgroups of patients with a higher risk of relapsing into the brain and novel drugs, active on either neoplastic or normal cells of the microenvironment, that are cooperating in the invasion of brain tissue.",Current Treatment Options in Oncology,"Alessia Pellerino, Francesco Bruno, Roberta Rudà, Riccardo Soffietti",,English,"Oncology and Carcinogenesis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Genes, erbB-1/genetics; Neoplastic Cells, Circulating; Circulating Tumor DNA; Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/metabolism; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/therapeutic use*; Medical and Health Sciences; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain Neoplasms; Humans; Genes, erbB-1; Lung Neoplasms; Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use*; Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase/genetics; Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors; Computational Biology; Chemoradiotherapy; Lung Neoplasms/genetics*/pathology; Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy*/genetics/secondary; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase; Gene Rearrangement; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Circulating Tumor DNA/blood/cerebrospinal fluid; Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy*/genetics/secondary; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Medicine",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34693454,,"non-small cell lung cancer, whole brain radiotherapy, brain metastases, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, stereotactic radiosurgery, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, lung cancer brain metastases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, tumor progression, rare molecular alterations, intracranial disease control, large prospective datasets, cancer brain metastases, combination of immunotherapy, subgroup of patients, cell lung cancer, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, start of treatment, actionable driver mutations, molecular pathways, true tumor progression, advanced MRI techniques, checkpoint inhibitors, cytotoxic chemotherapy, overall survival, systemic therapy, local therapy, targeted agents, lung cancer, CNS barriers, ineffective therapy, clinical trials, druggable mutations, high risk, prospective dataset, receptor mutations, solid tumors, molecular alterations, mutational status, therapy, brain tissue, tumor DNA, immunotherapy, disease control, tumor cells, patients, liquid biopsy, novel drugs, driver mutations, kinase inhibitors, early detection, MRI techniques, new drugs, drugs, common event, radionecrosis, radiotherapy, metastasis, normal cells, brain, progression, treatment, inhibitors, mutations, chemotherapy, cells, pseudoprogression, high molecular specificity, biopsy, chemoprevention, radiosurgery, tumors, agents, cancer, pathway, blood, prolongation, CSF, MRI, trials, months, survival, subgroups, utmost importance, better distinction, radiomics, risk, molecular specificity, invasion, exosomes, tissue, alterations, microenvironment, status, PET, specificity, disruption, combination, impressive number, new frontier, control, development, near future, start, detection, biofluids, DNA, events, resistance, barriers, successful development, regard, monitoring, use, rearrangement, deeper understanding, ability, discovery, number, time, importance, validation, major issue, results, challenges, understanding, emergence, values, future, remarkable results, technique, respect, distinction, issues, terms, dataset, order, frontier","Pellerino A, Bruno F, Rudà R, Soffietti R.

We investigated how the efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, the SLCO1A/1B uptake transporters and the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A influence pralsetinib pharmacokinetics. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In vitro, transepithelial pralsetinib transport was assessed. In vivo, pralsetinib (10 mg/kg) was administered orally to relevant genetically modified mouse models. Pralsetinib concentrations in cell medium, plasma samples and organ homogenates were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. KEY RESULTS: Pralsetinib was efficiently transported by human (h)ABCB1 and mouse (m)Abcg2, but not hACBG2. In vivo, mAbcb1a/1b markedly and mAbcg2 slightly limited pralsetinib brain penetration (6.3-and 1.8-fold, respectively). Testis distribution showed similar results. Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2-/- mice showed 1.5-fold higher plasma exposure, 23-fold increased brain penetration, and 4-fold reduced recovery of pralsetinib in the small intestinal content. mSlco1a/1b deficiency did not affect pralsetinib oral availability or tissue exposure. Oral coadministration of the ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar boosted pralsetinib plasma exposure (1.3-fold) and brain penetration (19.6-fold) in wild-type mice. Additionally, pralsetinib was a modest substrate of mCYP3A, but not of hCYP3A4, which did not noticeably restrict the oral availability or tissue distribution of pralsetinib. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: SLCO1A/1B and CYP3A4 are unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of pralsetinib, but ABCG2 and especially ABCB1 markedly limit its brain and testis penetration, as well as oral availability. These effects are mostly reversed by oral coadministration of the ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar. These insights may be useful in the further clinical development of pralsetinib.",Pharmacological Research,"Yaogeng Wang, Rolf W. Sparidans, Sander Potters, Maria C. Lebre, Jos H. Beijnen, Alfred H.

We aimed to identify the landscape of clinically relevant kinase fusions in Chinese lung cancer and to explore rare kinase rearrangements; thus, providing valuable evidence for therapeutic decision making. We performed genomic profiling of 425 cancer-relevant genes from tumor/plasma biopsies from a total of 17,442 Chinese lung cancer patients using next generation sequencing (NGS). Patients’ clinical characteristics and treatment histories were retrospectively studied. A total of 1162 patients (6.66%; 1162/17,442) were identified as having kinase fusions, including 906 adenocarcinomas (ADCs) and 35 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). In ADC, 170 unique gene fusion pairs were observed, including rare kinase fusions, SLC12A2-ROS1, NCOA4-RET, and ANK3-RET. As for SCC, 15 unique gene fusions were identified, among which the most frequent were EML4-ALK and FGFR3-TACC3. Analyses of oncogenic mutations revealed a dual role for the gene fusions, CCDC6-RET and FGFR3-TACC3, in driving oncogenesis or serving as acquired resistance mechanisms to kinase inhibitors. In addition, our real-world evidence showed that patients with recurrent kinase fusions with low frequency (two occurrences) could benefit from treatment with kinase inhibitors’ off-label use. Notably, patients with stage IV ADC who had novel RORB-ALK or AFF2-RET fusions, but no other known oncogenic driver mutations, demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes on tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Currently, several approved multikinase inhibitors such as vandetanib and cabozantinib demonstrate clinical activity in patients with RET-rearranged or RET-mutant cancers. However, the observed response rates are only modest and the 'off-target' toxicities resulted from the inhibition of other kinases is also a concern. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of RET inhibitors based on the structure of selective RET inhibitor BLU-667 and investigated their biological activities. We identified compound 9 as a novel potent and selective RET inhibitor with improved drug-like properties. Compound 9 exhibits a selective inhibitory profile with an inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) of 1.29 nM for RET and 1.97 (RET V804M) or 0.99 (RET M918T) for mutant RETs. The proliferation of Ba/F3 cells transformed with NSCLC related KIF5B-RET fusion was effectively suppressed by compound 9 (IC50 = 19 nM). Additionally, compound 9 displayed less 'off-target' effects than BLU-667. In mouse xenograft models, compound 9 repressed tumor growth driven by KIF5B-RET-Ba/F3 cells in a dose-dependent manner.

Phase II studies indicated the limited efficacy of multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with NSCLC that have a confirmed RET event. Consequently, there has been ongoing research to develop more potent and specific RET tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Targeted therapy has improved the survival period of patients with positive mutation of tumor driver gene. More and more targets have been found gradually. Drugs targeting different driving genes have brought the treatment of NSCLC into a promising target era. Among the many driving genes of NSCLC, the fusion of transfection proto oncogene (RET) is the addition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), analytic lymphama kinase (ALK) and c-ros oncogene 1-receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1) are emerging targets. Targeted drugs for RET gene fusion have been constantly updated. Recently, new high selective RET inhibitors blu-667 and loxo-292 have made important breakthroughs. This paper will review the review of the fusion mutation of RET gene in NSCLC, the detection methods, clinicopathological characteristics, targeted treatment and the research progress after drug resistance. .",Zhongguo fei ai za zhi = Chinese journal of lung cancer,"Yujun Zheng, Wei Jiang, Dongyan Chen, Yanjun Li, Lulu Dai, Lei Huang, Mingji Wang","Department of Oncology, The Friendship Hospital of Dalian, Dalian 116001, China.",Chinese,"Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics*; Humans; Pyrimidines/therapeutic use; Lung Neoplasms*/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Pyrazoles/therapeutic use; Mutation; Pyridines/therapeutic use; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung*/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8387645,,"Fusion gene, Lung neoplasms, Transfection proto-oncogene gene","Zheng Y, Jiang W, Chen D, Li Y, Dai L, Huang L, Wang M.

However, with the advancement of technology and research, it has become clear now that thyroid cancer cells are driven by various mutations. Targeting these oncogenic drivers by various molecules have proven to be effective therapeutic strategy in thyroid cancer. Besides, as in other solid tumors, immunotherapy is also being evaluated in thyroid cancer. While these new therapeutic approaches have revolutionized the treatment on advanced/metastatic thyroid cancer, there are definite challenges which limit their use in common clinical practice.

Baseline demographics (age, gender, ECOG PS, comorbidities, habits), tumor details (site of metastasis), previous treatment details, clinical features at metastasis (symptomatic or asymptomatic), the pattern of treatment, adverse events (CTCAE version 4.02), date of progression, date of death and status, and follow-up were extracted from the rare tumor database and electronic medical records. Out of 75 patients referred for therapy for MCT, 47 (62.7%) patients were considered for immediate tyrosine kinase inhibitors as they had symptomatic status and 28 (37.3%) patients were kept on observation due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease. Out of the 28 patients, 15 (53.6%, n = 28) patients were subsequently started on TKI while in 13 (46.4%, n = 28) patients observation was continued. In the overall cohort, the median PFS was 18.9 months (95% CI 11.9–29.9) and OS was 26.6 months (95% CI 14.4–39.0).

Consensus for ideal treatment of advanced and metastatic ATC remains elusive. This study aimed to analyze the impact of palliative chemotherapy versus supportive care on overall survival in patients with metastatic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Patients diagnosed with ATC between the period January 2018 and December 2019 were prospectively followed. The patients opting for palliative chemotherapy received 3 weekly Paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and Carboplatin (AUC-5). Out of the 31 patients diagnosed with ATC, clinicopathological profile of 29 patients was analyzed (2 patients who underwent upfront surgical resection with curative intent were excluded), out of which 20 patients were included in the survival analysis. The median age of presentation was 55.8 years with male:female ratio 1.9:1. Seventeen out of the total 29 patients presented with anaplastic transformation in long-standing goiter. Nineteen out of 20 (95%) patients presented with distant metastasis with lungs being the most common site. Nodal metastasis was present in all patients. Invasion of the strap muscles (90%) and trachea (80%) was the most common peri-thyroidal tissue invasion followed by invasion of the esophagus (40%), internal jugular vein (30%), and carotid artery (5%). Twelve out of the 20 patients opted for palliative chemotherapy.

We aimed to assess the safety and antitumour activity of pralsetinib, a highly potent, selective RET inhibitor, in patients with RET-altered thyroid cancers. METHODS: ARROW, a phase 1/2, open-label study done in 13 countries across 71 sites in community and hospital settings, enrolled patients 18 years or older with RET-altered locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours, including RET-mutant medullary thyroid and RET fusion-positive thyroid cancers, and an Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 (later limited to 0-1 in a protocol amendment). Phase 2 primary endpoints assessed for patients who received 400 mg once-daily oral pralsetinib until disease progression, intolerance, withdrawal of consent, or investigator decision, were overall response rate (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1; masked independent central review) and safety. Tumour response was assessed for patients with RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer who had received previous cabozantinib or vandetanib, or both, or were ineligible for standard therapy and patients with previously treated RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer; safety was assessed for all patients with RET-altered thyroid cancer. This ongoing study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03037385, and enrolment of patients with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer was ongoing at the time of this interim analysis. FINDINGS: Between Mar 17, 2017, and May 22, 2020, 122 patients with RET-mutant medullary and 20 with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancers were enrolled. Among patients with baseline measurable disease who received pralsetinib by July 11, 2019 (enrolment cutoff for efficacy analysis), overall response rates were 15 (71%) of 21 (95% CI 48-89) in patients with treatment-naive RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer and 33 (60%) of 55 (95% CI 46-73) in patients who had previously received cabozantinib or vandetanib, or both, and eight (89%) of nine (95% CI 52-100) in patients with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer (all responses confirmed for each group). Common (≥10%) grade 3 and above treatment-related adverse events among patients with RET-altered thyroid cancer enrolled by May 22, 2020, were hypertension (24 patients [17%] of 142), neutropenia (19 [13%]), lymphopenia (17 [12%]), and anaemia (14 [10%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in 21 patients (15%), the most frequent (≥2%) of which was pneumonitis (five patients [4%]). Five patients [4%] discontinued owing to treatment-related events. One (1%) patient died owing to a treatment-related adverse event.

It is defined as exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that does not heal within 8 weeks after a health care provider identification. ONJ can occur spontaneously or can be due to drugs like bisphosphonates (BPS) and anti-RANK agents, in patients with no history of external radiation therapy in the craniofacial region. Although in phase 3 trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used in thyroid cancer (TC) the ONJ was not reported among the most common side effects, several papers reported the association between ONJ and TKIs, both when they are used alone and in combination with a bisphosphonate. The appearance of an ONJ in a patient with metastatic radio-iodine refractory differentiated TC, treated with zoledronic acid and sorafenib, has put us in front of an important clinical challenge: when a ONJ occurred during TKIs treatment, it really worsens the patients’ quality of life. We should consider that in the case of ONJ a TKI discontinuation becomes necessary, and this could lead to a progression of neoplastic disease. The most important aim of this review is to aware the endocrinologists/oncologists dealing with TC to pay attention to this possible side effect of BPS and TKIs, especially when they are used in association. To significantly reduced the risk of ONJ, both preventive measures before initiating not only antiresorptive therapy but also antiangiogenic agents, and regular dental examinations during the treatment should always be proposed.",Journal of Endocrinological Investigation,"L.

Recent findings: The addition of mutational analysis to cytological assessment of thyroid nodules has improved the diagnostic accuracy of MTC. The discovery of new genomic alterations and overexpression of certain factors allows for improved prognostication in MTC and provides potentially new therapeutic agents. New data suggest that tumor environment may be more immunogenic than previously thought in a subset of MTCs with identification of a new MTC-specific antigen leading to a revival of investigating immune-based therapy for this disease. The newly approved selective rearranged during transfection (RET0-inhibitors, selpercatinib and pralsetinib, offer promising results, and tolerability for patients with RET-mutated MTC; however, the development of resistance mechanisms may be problematic. Summary: MTC has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years. Our new understanding of some of the driver mutations in MTC allows for therapeutics with more tolerable adverse event profiles. However, there is still a need for more effective treatment strategies for subsets of patients without actionable mutations and for those who develop resistance to currently available therapies.","Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity","Tania Jaber, Ramona Dadu, Mimi I.

Activating RET fusions are identified in approximately 1-2% of NSCLCs and have emerged as a targetable driver alteration. Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are RET-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with encouraging efficacy, intracranial activity, and tolerability that we recommend as first-line therapy. As with use of TKIs in other oncogene-addicted NSCLCs, development of acquired resistance is pervasive and should be specifically delineated through use of repeat tissue biopsy with genetic profiling at the time of disease progression. If an actionable resistance mechanism emerges for which there is a candidate targeted therapy, combination inhibition should be considered. Alternatively, or in the absence of such findings, platinum doublet chemotherapy or particularly platinum-pemetrexed therapy with or without bevacizumab demonstrates a moderate effect.We would not recommend the routine use of nonselective multi-targeted TKIs such as cabozantinib and vandetanib, which have modest activity but limited tolerability due to predictable off-target effects. Single-agent immunotherapy has minimal activity in RET fusion-positive NSCLC. The role of combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy requires further study but may be considered, particularly in the presence of an activating KRAS alteration. While further development of novel RET-selective TKIs may address common RET-specific resistance mutations, they will not have activity against off-target, RET-independent resistance mechanisms. This again highlights the importance of serial biopsy and next-generation sequencing for the rational choice of sequential therapy in RET fusion-positive NSCLC.",Current Treatment Options in Oncology,"Fangdi Sun, Caroline E.

To summarize FDA updates applicable to neuro-oncology practitioners, we sought to review oncology product approvals and Guidances that were pertinent to the field in the past year. METHODS: Oncology product approvals between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, were reviewed for clinical trial outcomes involving tumors of the nervous system. FDA Guidances relevant to neuro-oncology were also reviewed. RESULTS: Five oncology product approvals described outcomes for nervous system tumors in the year 2020. These included the first regulatory approval for neurofibromatosis type 1: selumetinib for children with symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas. Additionally, there were 4 regulatory approvals for non-central nervous system (CNS) cancers that described clinical outcomes for patients with brain metastases. These included the approval of tucatinib for metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer including patients with brain metastases, brigatinib for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and pralsetinib and selpercatinib for RET fusion-positive NSCLC. Finally, two FDA Guidances for Industry, 'Cancer Clinical Trial Eligibility Criteria: Brain Metastases' and 'Evaluating Cancer Drugs in Patients with Central Nervous System Metastases' were published to facilitate drug development for and inclusion of patients with CNS metastases in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the challenges of the past year brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, progress continues to be made in neuro-oncology.

Most newly approved drugs related to oncology (34%) and neurology (15%). We discuss these new drugs by level of innovation they provide, i.e., first to treat a condition, first using a novel mechanisms of action, and “others.” Six drugs were first in indication, 15 first using a novel mechanism of action, and 32 other. This includes many drugs for the treatment of orphan indications and some for the treatment of tropical diseases previously neglected for commercial reasons. Small molecules continue to dominate new drug approvals, followed by antibodies. Of note, newly approved drugs also included small-interfering RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides.

However, many agents are associated with characteristic ophthalmic adverse effects. It is important that ophthalmologists recognize and maintain a high index of suspicion for these side effects in patients on targeted therapy. Most ophthalmic adverse effects can be treated with specific ocular therapy without discontinuation of cancer treatment, although it is important to be aware of the life-threatening and vision-threatening circumstances that would require therapy cessation in conjunction with the patient’s oncologist.

Multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) showing anti-RET activities have been tested in RET-altered tumours with variable results. The low target specificity with consequent increase in side-effects and off-target toxicities resulting in dose reduction and drug discontinuation are some of the major issues with MKIs. To overcome these issues, new selective RET inhibitors such as pralsetinib (BLU-667) and selpercatinib (LOXO-292) have been developed in clinical trials, with selpercatinib recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The results of these trials showed marked and durable antitumour activity and manageable toxicity profiles in patients with RET-altered tumours. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Translational Research and Precision Medicine Working Group (TR and PM WG) launched a collaborative project to review the available methods for the detection of RET gene alterations, their potential applications and strategies for the implementation of a rational approach for the detection of RET fusion genes and mutations in human malignancies.

There are 62 FDA-approved therapeutic agents that target about two dozen different protein kinases and eight of these were approved in 2020. All of the FDA-approved drugs are orally effective with the exception of netarsudil (a ROCK1/2 non-receptor protein-serine/threonine kinase antagonist given as an eye drop for the treatment of glaucoma) and temsirolimus (an indirect mTOR inhibitor given intravenously for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma). Of the approved drugs, ten target protein-serine/threonine protein kinases, four are directed against dual specificity protein kinases (MEK1/2), thirteen block non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and 35 target receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. The data indicate that 55 of these drugs are prescribed for the treatment of neoplasms (52 against solid tumors including breast, lung, and colon, nine against non-solid tumors such as leukemias, and four against both solid and non-solid tumors: acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, imatinib, and midostaurin). A total of three drugs (baricitinib, tofacitinib, upadacitinib) is used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. Seven of the approved drugs form covalent bonds with their target enzymes and are classified as TCIs (targeted covalent inhibitors). Of the 62 approved drugs, eighteen are used in the treatment of multiple diseases. Imatinib, for example, is approved for the treatment of eight different disorders. The most common drug targets of the approved pharmaceuticals include BCR-Abl, B-Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), and ALK. The following eight drugs received FDA approval in 2020 for the treatment of the specified diseases: avapritinib and ripretinib (gastrointestinal stromal tumors), capmatinib (non-small cell lung cancer), pemigatinib (cholangiocarcinoma), pralsetinib and selpercatinib (non-small cell lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, differentiated thyroid cancer), selumetinib (neurofibromatosis type I), and tucatinib (HER2-positive breast cancer). All of the eight drugs approved in 2020 fulfill Lipinski's rule of five criteria for an orally effective medicine (MW of 500 Da or less, five or fewer hydrogen bond donors, 10 or fewer hydrogen bond acceptors, calculated log10 of the partition coefficient of five or less) with the exception of three drugs with a molecular weight greater that 500 Da: pralsetinib (534), selpercatinib (526) and ripretinib (510).

RET gene rearrangements are observed in papillary thyroid carcinoma, which result in RET fusion products. By contrast, single amino acid substitutions and small insertions and/or deletions are typical of hereditary and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma. RET rearrangements and mutations of extracellular cysteines facilitate dimerization and kinase activation, whereas mutations in the RET kinase coding domain drive dimerization-independent kinase activation. Thus, RET kinase inhibition is an attractive therapeutic target in patients with RET alterations. This approach was initially achieved using multikinase inhibitors, which affect multiple deregulated pathways that include RET kinase. In clinical practice, use of multikinase inhibitors in patients with advanced thyroid cancer resulted in therapeutic efficacy, which was associated with frequent and sometimes severe adverse effects. However, remarkable progress has been achieved with the identification of novel potent and selective RET kinase inhibitors for the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer. Although expanded clinical validation in future trials is needed, the sustained antitumoural activity and the improved safety profile of these novel compounds is opening a new exciting era in precision oncology for RET-driven cancers.",Nature reviews.

New multikinase and selective inhibitor treatments for medullary thyroid cancer, radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer have completed trials and improved progression-free survival. Many physicians are concerned by dose-limiting adverse effects of these drugs and are wary to begin treatment in patients who are systemically well but have marked disease burden, which makes the timing of treatment initiation challenging. Published mechanistic data on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have helped guide our understanding of how to dose effectively with these drugs. A major goal in TKI therapy is to optimize inhibition of oncogenic kinase drivers while maintaining patient quality of life. Real-world data have now been published on how TKIs have fared outside the clinical trial environment. In this Review, we provide a summary of published data on the efficacy of TKIs in clinical practice, to provide clinicians with a more realistic view of how their patients will manage and respond to TKI therapy.

After the loss of clinical benefit with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), we evaluated the use of lenvatinib as salvage therapy. METHODS: Ten patients who experienced the loss of clinical benefit after treatment with at least one previous TKI, were treated with lenvatinib. We assessed patient's response immediately before, at the first (first-EV) and last (last-EV) evaluation, after the beginning of treatment. RESULTS: At first-EV, one patient died, while all the remaining 9 showed a stable disease (SD) in the target lesions. At last-EV, SD was still observed in seven patients, while partial response (PR) and progressive disease (PD), in one patient each. Conversely, analyzing all target and non-target lesions, at first-EV, we observed PR in one patient and SD in eight patients. At last-EV, PR was shown in two patients and SD was shown in seven. Bone metastases showed stable disease control at both first-EV and last-EV in only approximately 60% of cases. Tumor markers (CTN and CEA) decreased at first-EV, while they increased at last-EV. Seven patients experienced at least one dose reduction during treatment with lenvatinib. CONCLUSIONS: In this real-life clinical experience, lenvatinib showed interesting results as salvage therapy in patients with advanced progressive metastatic MTC patients.

This includes matching patients with specific point mutations or gene fusions to targeted therapies (e.g., selective RET inhibitors), delineating patients who are likely to respond to immune checkpoint inhibition (i.e., PD-L1-positive tumors) and even priming responses to traditional therapies such as radioactive iodine (via concomitant MAPK pathway inhibition). There is also a growing role for genomics in the prognostication of thyroid tumors to aid the adjudication of appropriate treatments. Taking stock of the current state of the field, recent successes should be celebrated, but there still remains a long road ahead to improve outcomes for patients, particularly for radioactive-iodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer.

It is critical to analyze RET mutants resistant to these drugs and unravel the molecular basis to improve patient outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cell-free DNAs (cfDNAs) were analyzed in a RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) patient and a CCDC6-RET fusion NSCLC patient who had dramatic response to selpercatinib and later developed resistance. Selpercatinib-resistant RET mutants were identified and cross-profiled with pralsetinib in cell cultures. Crystal structures of RET-selpercatinib and RET-pralsetinib complexes were determined based on high-resolution diffraction data collected with synchrotron radiation. RESULTS: RETG810C/S mutations at the solvent front and RETY806C/N mutation at the hinge region were found in cfDNAs of an MTC patient with RETM918T/V804M/L, who initially responded to selpercatinib and developed resistance. RETG810C mutant was detected in cfDNAs of a CCDC6-RET-fusion NSCLC patient who developed acquired resistance to selpercatinib. Five RET kinase domain mutations at three non-gatekeeper residues were identified from 39 selpercatinib-resistant cell lines. All five selpercatinib-resistant RET mutants were cross-resistant to pralsetinib. X-ray crystal structures of the RET-selpercatinib and RET-pralsetinib complexes reveal that, unlike other TKIs, these two RET TKIs anchor one end in the front cleft and wrap around the gate wall to access the back cleft.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of potential DDIs and major DDIs among individuals newly diagnosed with lung cancer in a national cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of adult patients in the United States Veterans' Affairs (VA) medical system diagnosed with lung cancer between 2003 and 2016. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of prescriptions for medications associated with any potential DDIs during the 3 months leading up to and including the date of lung cancer diagnosis. The secondary endpoint was the prevalence of prescriptions associated with major DDIs during the same time period. RESULTS: Overall, 280,068 patients were included in the study; 55.9% of patients were prescribed medications associated with potential DDIs, while 5.3% received prescriptions for medications associated with major DDIs. Among the 20 most commonly prescribed drugs associated with potential DDIs, only two were associated with major DDIs. CONCLUSION: Medications with potential DDIs are prescribed to the majority of patients with lung cancer; however, only about 5% of patients are prescribed medications with major DDIs that might be prohibited in certain clinical trials.",Clinical Drug Investigation,"Sawsan Rashdan, Hui Yang, Tri Le, Christopher Selby, David E.

In some cases, these alterations have been recognized as having a pathogenic role and targeted therapies capable of inhibiting tumor proliferation by selective and specific blocking of the enzymatic activity of the related abnormal proteins have been developed. This has made it possible to improve the effectiveness of the treatments by minimizing toxicity. Today it is essential to apply Comprehensive Genomic Profiling methods also in clinical practice, in order to allow the best treatment available for each patient, possibly also in the context of clinical trials. Below we report the clinical history of a patient with advanced stage adenocarcinoma of the lung with molecular diagnosis of RET fusion, treated with pralsetinib with excellent clinical and radiological response and good tolerability.

These alterations should be searched especially in young and never-smoker patients, in order to ensure access to targeted therapies. In particular, RET mutations occur in 1-2% of lung adenocarcinomas and represent the molecular target of innovative treatments such as pralsetinib. The Next Generation Sequencing provides a comprehensive genomic profiling both on tissue and blood sampling. The liquid biopsy could be extremely advantageous, as it is a simple, non-invasive and repeatable test.

Currently, there are several FDA-approved RET inhibitors, but their indication is limited to thyroid cancer, and none can overcome their gatekeeper mutants (V804L and V804M). Here, we report the discovery of 9x representing a new chemotype of potent and selective RET inhibitors, using a rational design strategy of type II kinase inhibitors. 9x exhibited both superior antiproliferative activities against NSCLC-related carcinogenic fusions KIF5B-RET and CCDC6-RET and gatekeeper mutant-transformed Ba/F3 cells, with the lowest GI50 of 9 nM, and substantial inhibitory activities against wild-type RET and RET mutant proteins, with the best IC50 of 4 nM. More importantly, 9x also showed nanomole potency against RET-positive NSCLC cells LC-2/ad, but not against a panel of RET-negative cancer cells, such as A549, H3122, A375 or parental Ba/F3 cells, demonstrating its selective 'on-target' effect. In mouse xenograft models, 9x repressed tumor growth driven by both wild type KIF5B-RET-Ba/F3 and gatekeeper mutant KIF5B-RET(V804M)-Ba/F3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these data establish that 9x provides a good starting point for the development of targeted therapeutics against RET-positive cancers, especially NSCLC.",European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,"Xiaoyang Li, Jingyi Su, Yanru Yang, Wenhua Lian, Zhou Deng, Zaiyou Yang, Guyue Chen, Baoding Zhang, Chao Dong, Xueyan Liu, Li Li, Zheng Wang, Zhiyu Hu, Qingyan Xu, Xianming Deng",,English,"Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Mutation*; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Pyrazoles/chemistry*/pharmacology*; Drug Design*; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/antagonists & inhibitors*/genetics; Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology; Cell Proliferation/drug effects; Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry*/pharmacology*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32882611,,"CCDC6-RET, KIF5B-RET, Non-small cell lung cancer, RET inhibitor, Structure-activity relationship","Li X, Su J, Yang Y, Lian W, Deng Z, Yang Z, Chen G, Zhang B, Dong C, Liu X, Li L, Wang Z, Hu Z, Xu Q, Deng X.

RET-selective inhibitors selpercatinib (LOXO-292) and pralsetinib (BLU-667) recently demonstrated favorable antitumor activity and safety profiles in advanced RET fusion-positive NSCLC, and both have received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication. Insights into mechanisms of resistance to selective RET inhibitors remain limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was performed at five institutions. Tissue and/or cell-free DNA was obtained from patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC after treatment with selpercatinib or pralsetinib and assessed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) or MET FISH. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 23 post-treatment tissue and/or plasma biopsies from 18 RET fusion-positive patients who received an RET-selective inhibitor (selpercatinib, n = 10; pralsetinib, n = 7; pralsetinib followed by selpercatinib, n = 1, with biopsy after each inhibitor). Three cases had paired tissue and plasma samples, of which one also had two serial resistant tissue specimens. The median progression-free survival on RET inhibitors was 6.3 months [95% confidence interval 3.6-10.8 months]. Acquired RET mutations were identified in two cases (10%), both affecting the RET G810 residue in the kinase solvent front. Three resistant cases (15%) harbored acquired MET amplification without concurrent RET resistance mutations, and one specimen had acquired KRAS amplification. No other canonical driver alterations were identified by NGS. Among 16 resistant tumor specimens, none had evidence of squamous or small-cell histologic transformation. CONCLUSIONS: RET solvent front mutations are a recurrent mechanism of RET inhibitor resistance, although they occurred at a relatively low frequency. The majority of resistance to selective RET inhibition may be driven by RET-independent resistance such as acquired MET or KRAS amplification. Next-generation RET inhibitors with potency against RET resistance mutations and combination strategies are needed to effectively overcome resistance in these patients.",Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,"J.J.

Multikinase inhibitors such as cabozantinib, lenvatinib and vandetanib have demonstrated activity in RET-dependent malignancies, and selective RET inhibitors (Selpercatinib and Pralsetinib) are in clinical trials. However, the responsiveness of RET-dependent malignancies to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is unknown. We compared the time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) for ICI versus non-ICI therapy in patients with malignancies harbouring activating RET mutations or fusions (RET+). METHODS: A retrospective review of all RET+ patients who were referred to the phase I clinical trials programme at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center was conducted. TTD was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model was performed to identify independent risk factors of treatment discontinuation. RESULTS: Of 70 patients who received systemic therapy for RET+ malignancies, 20 (28.6%) received ICI and 50 (71.4%) received non-ICI therapy. Non-ICI therapy was associated with decreased risk for treatment discontinuation compared with ICI in the overall population (HR=0.31; 95% CI 0.16-0.62; p=0.000834) and in patients with RET point mutations (HR=0.13; 95% CI 0.04-0.45; p=0.00134). In patients with RET fusions, non-ICI therapy was associated with a non-statistically significant decreased risk of treatment discontinuation (HR=0.59; 95% CI 0.25-1.4; p=0.24). ICI therapy and a diagnosis other than medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) were independent risk factors for treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the prioritisation of non-ICI over ICI therapy in patients with RET+ tumours.",ESMO Open,"Aparna Hegde, Alexander Y.

In this study, a bioanalytical assay was developed and fully validated for selpercatinib and pralsetinib in mouse plasma and partially in eight mouse tissue homogenates using liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometry. Samples were pre-treated by protein precipitation with acetonitrile using erlotinib as internal standard. Separation of the analytes was performed on an ethylene bridged octadecyl silica C18 column by gradient elution using ammonium hydroxide (in water) and methanol. Analytes were detected by positive electrospray ionization in selected reaction monitoring mode. A linear concentration range of 2-2000 ng/ml was used for the validation of the assay for both inhibitors. The precision values (within-day and between-day) ranged between 3.4 and 10.2% for selpercatinib and 3.1-14.6% for pralsetinib in all matrices. Furthermore, data obtained for accuracy were between 91.7 and 109.3% and 85.1-114.1% for selpercatinib and pralsetinib, respectively. No significant matrix effects or extraction losses were observed and both analytes were stable under all investigated conditions. Finally, a pilot study for selpercatinib in mice was conducted employing this method, followed by a successful incurred sample reanalysis.","Journal of chromatography.

Fusion of RET with several partner genes has been detected in papillary thyroid, lung, colorectal, pancreatic and breast cancers, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for RET (particularly RET-specific inhibitors) show promising therapeutic effects against such cancers. Oncogenic mutations within the extracellular cysteine-rich and intracellular kinase domains of RET drive medullary thyroid carcinogenesis; the same mutations are also observed in a small subset of diverse cancers such as lung, colorectal and breast cancers. Considering the oncogenic nature of RET mutants, lung, colorectal and breast cancers are predicted to respond to RET TKIs in a manner similar to medullary thyroid cancer. In summary, cancers carrying oncogenic RET alterations as a driver mutation could be collectively termed ‘REToma’ and treated with RET TKIs in a tissue-agnostic manner.",Carcinogenesis,"Takashi Kohno, Junya Tabata, Takashi Nakaoku","Division of Genome Biology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan",English,"Pyridines/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics*; Mice, Transgenic; Animals; Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use*; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics*; Pyrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Humans; Disease Models, Animal; Mice; Clinical Trials as Topic; Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics*; Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use; Mutation; Carcinogenesis/drug effects/genetics*",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31711124,,,"Kohno T, Tabata J, Nakaoku T.

No approved therapies have been designed to target RET; treatment has been limited to multikinase inhibitors (MKI), which can have significant off-target toxicities and limited efficacy. BLU-667 is a highly potent and selective RET inhibitor designed to overcome these limitations. In vitro, BLU-667 demonstrated ≥10-fold increased potency over approved MKIs against oncogenic RET variants and resistance mutants. In vivo, BLU-667 potently inhibited growth of NSCLC and thyroid cancer xenografts driven by various RET mutations and fusions without inhibiting VEGFR2. In first-in-human testing, BLU-667 significantly inhibited RET signaling and induced durable clinical responses in patients with RET-altered NSCLC and MTC without notable off-target toxicity, providing clinical validation for selective RET targeting. Significance: Patients with RET-driven cancers derive limited benefit from available MKIs. BLU-667 is a potent and selective RET inhibitor that induces tumor regression in cancer models with RET mutations and fusions. BLU-667 attenuated RET signaling and produced durable clinical responses in patients with RET-altered tumors, clinically validating selective RET targeting. Cancer Discov; 8(7); 836–49. ©2018 AACR.
